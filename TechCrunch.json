      "content": "\nIn its most recent quarter, Microsoft reported $62 billion worth of revenue, $27 billion worth of operating income, and $21.9 billion worth of net income. It also recently cut 1,900 jobs. Alphabet reported $86.3 billion worth of revenue, operating income worth $23.7 billion, net income of $20.7 billion, and an employee count that was down by nearly 8,000 compared to the year-ago period.\nOn one hand, two of tech\u2019s best-known names just turned in results that put their operating profit at or around the $100 billion annual run-rate mark. On the other hand, both have worked in recent periods to control costs via layoffs. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\nThere\u2019s a similar vibe in startup land, where venture capital totals are in decline and many startups are stuck between funding rounds or between the private and public markets. At the same time, there are a host of incredibly interesting upstart tech companies building new tools and services with or atop AI models that are themselves rapidly advancing. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ",

      "title": "FCC moves to outlaw AI-generated robocalls",
      "content": "\nNo one likes robocalls to begin with, but using AI-generated voices of people like President Biden makes them even worse. As such the FCC is proposing that using voice cloning tech in robocalls be ruled fundamentally illegal, making it easier to charge the operators of these frauds.\nYou may ask why it\u2019s necessary if robocalls are illegal to begin with. In fact some automated calls are necessary and even desirable, and it\u2019s only when a call operation is found to be breaking the law in some way that it becomes the business of the authorities.\nFor example, regarding the recent fake Biden calls in New Hampshire telling people not to vote, the attorney general there can (and did) say with confidence that the messages \u201cappear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters.\u201d\nUnder the law there, voter suppression is illegal and so, when they track down the perpetrators (and I\u2019m emailing them constantly to find out if they have, by the way) that will be what they are charged with, likely among other things. But it remains that a crime must be committed, or reasonably suspected to have been committed, for the authorities to step in.\nIf employing voice cloning tech in automated calls, like what was obviously used on Biden, is itself illegal, that makes charging robocallers that much easier.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the FCC is taking steps to recognize this emerging technology as illegal under existing law, giving our partners at State Attorneys General offices across the country new tools they can use to crack down on these scams and protect consumers,\u201d said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a news release. They previously announced that they were looking into this back when the problem was relatively fresh.\n\nFCC aims to investigate the risk of AI-enhanced robocalls\n\nThe FCC already uses the Telephone Consumer Protection Act as the basis for charging robocallers and other telephone scammers. The TCPA already prohibits \u201cartificial\u201d voices, but it is not clear that cloned voices fall under that category. It\u2019s arguable, for instance, that a company could use the generated voice of its CEO for legitimate business purposes.\nBut the fact is that legal applications of the tech are fewer in number and less immediately important than the illegal applications. Therefore the FCC proposes to issue a Declaratory Ruling that AI-powered voice cloning causes a call to fall under the \u201cartificial\u201d heading.\nThe law here is being rapidly iterated as telephone, messaging and generative voice tech all evolve. So don\u2019t be surprised if it isn\u2019t entirely clear what is and isn\u2019t illegal, or why despite being obviously illegal, some calls or scams seem to operate with impunity. It\u2019s a work in progress.\nUpdate: FCC spokesman Will Wiquist told me that procedurally, this proposal will be propagated internally and voted on at Commissioners\u2019 discretion. It will only be public when and if it is adopted.\n",

      "content": "\nMetronome, a startup that helps software companies offer usage-based billing, has raised $43 million in a Series B funding round led by NEA.\nExisting backers Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst also participated in the financing, which brings its total amount raised to over $78 million since its 2019 inception.\u00a0\nFounded by Dropbox alums Kevin Liu and Scott Woody, San Francisco-based Metronome says it saw a 6x increase in ARR last year as more companies transitioned from subscription to usage-based models, or a combination of both. Its customers include startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic and enterprise companies like Databricks and Nvidia. Initially, Metronome worked with startups but last year expanded to the enterprise.\n\u201cWe were fortunate to see that growth during what was otherwise a tough year for SaaS,\u201d said Liu. \u201cCompanies have been cutting spend on \u2018nice-to-have\u2019 software, but we\u2019re seen as a core driver of revenue opportunities for our customers. The rise of AI has also been a big factor (many AI companies are adopting usage-based models), as has the desire from companies to move away from pure subscription and seat-based models to more hybrid and usage-based approaches.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, Metronome itself has a usage-based model.\nThe startup declined to reveal its valuation, saying only that \u201cit was a very healthy multiple above\u201d its Series A valuation.\u00a0\n\u201cWe still had nearly all of our Series A in the bank and were heavily oversubscribed,\u201d said Woody.\u00a0\nThe draw for AI companies\nMetronome claims to \u201cdramatically reduce\u201d the engineering investment required by companies for billing integration and maintenance.\n\u201cWe help teams launch products quickly, offer any pricing and streamline quote-to-cash workflows, all without engineering effort,\u201d said Liu. It does that with a data platform that it says offers integrations \u201cout-of-the-box, so engineering teams can just point their data stream directly at Metronome and skip having to own and maintain a lot of their own infrastructure.\u201d\nFor enterprises in particular, Metronome claimed that transitioning to cloud and/or usage-based revenue would typically require overhauling their financial stack. Its product, Liu said, helps facilitate that transition \u201cwhile plugging into their existing tooling, minimizing disruption and drastically speeding up the process.\u201d\nAI companies in particular seem to be drawn to Metronome\u2019s offering, the company claims.\n\u201cThe entire AI stack has usage-based COGS, from APIs down to the GPU infrastructure layer, which means that AI businesses often turn to usage-based pricing to keep their margins consistent,\u201d said Woody. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge amount of inbound interest from companies looking to monetize new AI products.\u201d\nGrowing headcount\nTo help meet that demand, over the last year, Metronome doubled its headcount to 66 full-time employees, growing its staff by more than 40% in the last quarter alone. It claims to \u201cstill have a lot of hiring to do this year,\u201d particularly across its R&D and customer-facing teams.\nThe company also plans to use its new funding to advance on its product roadmap.\n\u201cThis capital also gives us a tremendous amount of dry powder and runway, which is important in an uncertain environment like this,\u201d said Liu. \u201cWe\u2019re building critical infrastructure, so customers need to know that we\u2019ll be around for the long haul.\u201d\nAs part of the funding round, NEA partner Hilarie Koplow-McAdams has joined Metronome\u2019s board of directors.\u00a0\n\u201cBilling is often under resourced internally and seen as a bottleneck for product launches and pricing changes. In reality, it\u2019s a make-or-break revenue driver for any business,\u201d she said in a written statement. \u201cMetronome makes it possible for companies to operationalize new business models quickly. Every customer we spoke to shared how Metronome turned billing from a \u2018hair-on-fire\u2019 problem to a system that just works.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMetronome raises $30M to help software companies shift to usage-based pricing models\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

      "title": "Cerulean empowers ocean pollution watchdogs with orbital observation",
      "content": "\nThe vastness of the ocean allows polluters to evade detection in all but the most egregious violations. SkyTruth aims to change that with Cerulean, an orbital monitoring platform for coastal waters that spots not just oil slicks but also the ships that produce them faster and with more certainty than ever before.\nThe nonprofit organization has been around for more than 20 years, acting as a watchdog and advocate in situations like oil spills and conservation efforts. Satellite imagery has always been helpful in such cases, but it was only recently that the frequency and quality of the data started becoming good enough to apply in close to real time.\nThough we\u2019re still a ways off of detecting an oil spill or leak the moment it happens, many areas of Earth are imaged multiple times per day or even per hour in extremely high definition. This data could help pinpoint the time and extent of an oil leak from an offshore drilling operation before it spreads too far.\nCerulean is the software platform they\u2019ve built to ingest and analyze orbital imagery and other data both to identify and catch polluters and to provide improved estimates of pollution in waters around the world.\nThis kind of data is difficult to get straight from official sources, since they in turn rely on reports of vessel activity and other indirect metrics. Establishing the existence of a spill, dumping, or other illegal activity in the first place is hard enough, but to clearly state its magnitude is harder, and to assign responsibility is harder still.\nBut with satellites watching and Cerulean analyzing, the problem and its producer can be positively identified sometimes in a single image.\nThe platform looks not at the visual spectrum, but at synthetic aperture radar data, which is able to detect differences in textures on the surface \u2014 like the difference between oil and water. Cerulean\u2019s makers built a machine learning model that identifies any suspicious slicks or trails, and then allows users to rewind and find vessels that were pinged nearby at the time.\nImage Credits: Cerulean\nIt\u2019s easy to use; I found a slick and the vessel that almost certainly left it behind in about 30 seconds. You can try it here yourself \u2014 just be aware it\u2019s \u201cin beta,\u201d like so many things.\nOf course, natural oil seeps, turbulence, shadows, and other innocuous activity can look a bit like oil slicks. And not all vessels \u2014 perhaps not even a majority of vessels \u2014 are persistently tracked via their beacons, as Global Fishing Watch found out. (Perhaps not surprisingly, the two organizations work with one another.)\n\nSatellite imagery analysis shows immense scale of dark fishing industry\n\nThis means that Cerulean isn\u2019t a solution in itself but a tool to be used in conjunction with others, and with human supervision. But even non-experts can use it, they point out, and the data is compelling without any kind of academic or advocacy trappings.\nImage Credits: Cerulean\nFor instance, in a study conducted in 2022, SkyTruth pointed out that European authorities confirmed reports of 32 oil slicks of human origin. But based on the satellite data, they believe the number is probably a hundred times higher \u2014 3,000 or so. Similarly, it was once estimated that about half of oil slicks are natural. A SAR study suggested it\u2019s more like 6%. When the estimates are off by orders of magnitude, it does make you think!\nThis week, SkyTruth is publishing five case studies, short reports about recent projects with advocacy groups around the globe. Here\u2019s what they\u2019ve been getting up to:\n\nThe Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense has been using Cerulean to monitor deep-water drilling infrastructure for leaks and spills. They hope to create daily alerts for fishermen, who not only are at direct health risk from slicks, but also catch fewer and unhealthy fish as well. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to fill an information gap to pursue litigation that will help communities go after compensation for the harm caused by these spills,\u201d said the group\u2019s attorney, Santiago Pi\u00f1eros Dur\u00e1n.\nThe Indonesia Ocean Justice Initiative is hoping to quantify and improve accountability for the very frequent spills in Indonesia. The nation\u2019s highly active maritime sector, according to Cerulean data, produces as many oil slicks as the next five countries combined \u2014 over 100 per year on average. With facts like these, IOJI and others working toward change in the country\u2019s regulatory structure will have something to point to in court.\nRunner of a small Indonesian resort, Andrew Dixon uses Cerulean to monitor the coast off of Bintan, where \u2014 lucky for him \u2014 there haven\u2019t been any major spills in a decade. But the next time there is one, or even a persistent small one, he\u2019ll see it and report it. \u201cBeing able to match a spill to a ship\u2019s traffic is amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, this has been a laborious process, but now it\u2019s all automated. Just letting captains know they are being watched is powerful.\u201d\nU.K. climate advocacy organization Uplift used Cerulean data to look at the frequency and size of oil spills affecting the country\u2019s waters. It\u2019s obvious that leaked or spilled oil harms wildlife, but the scale of the harm depends on the scale of the spills. \u201cBy mapping oil slicks hundreds of miles offshore, SkyTruth helped us quantify and visualize the harm being caused and strengthen the case for an end to new oil and gas production in the North Sea,\u201d said Uplift\u2019s Daniel Jones.\nThe 2022 report cited above regarding bilge dumping (32 vs. 3,000 slicks) exposes the actual scale of this problem, which is a necessary step to creating new practices and regulations around it.\n\nCerulean is a work in progress \u2014 though you can use it today, it\u2019s being iterated on constantly. CTO Jason Schatz noted in response to my questions that the model itself is being improved, but that users who want to avoid false positives should restrict it to high-confidence identifications. And it\u2019s strictly based on orbital observation and ship beacon data \u2014 no one goes out in a dinghy and makes sure it\u2019s really oil.\n\u201cWe have manually inspected satellite imagery at several hundred locations,\u201d he pointed out, though. \u201cWe can never be perfectly confident of the composition of a slick using satellite data alone, but it is the best we can do at scale.\u201d\nThis scale of visibility is indeed only available via satellite, and via the machine learning models that turn reams of data no human has time to analyze into usable analyses. SkyTruth\u2019s plan for 2024 is to improve Cerulean with the improved model Schatz mentioned, an interface for users to set up alerts for new slicks, more training and feedback sessions with partners, and of course more work with concerned organizations and individuals. You can keep up with SkyTruth here.\n",

      "title": "Twin Labs automates repetitive tasks by letting AI take over your mouse cursor",
      "content": "\nMeet Twin Labs, a Paris-based startup that wants to build an automation product for repetitive tasks, such as onboarding new employees to all your internal services, reordering items when you\u2019re running out of stock, downloading financial reports across several SaaS products, reaching out to potential prospects and more.\n\u201cTwin\u2019s starting point is a science-fiction idea. We saw the development of the technical capabilities of LLMs \u2014 foundation models. And the question we asked ourselves was whether we\u2019d be able to duplicate ourselves by training an AI agent on the way we perform our tasks,\u201d Twin Labs co-founder and CEO Hugo Mercier told me.\nIn Twin Labs\u2019 case, the most interesting thing isn\u2019t what they\u2019re doing \u2014 improving internal processes \u2014 but how they\u2019re doing it. The company relies on multimodal models with vision capabilities, such as GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V), to replicate what humans usually do.\nBefore landing on multimodal models, Twin Labs first tried to develop autonomous agents using traditional LLMs. \u201cWe\u2019ve tested lots of things, we\u2019ve implemented research papers, we\u2019ve tested open source GitHub repositories. Overall, the conclusion is that LLMs are completely unreliable. This means that LLMs are making the wrong decisions,\u201d Mercier said. \u201cIn the end, the task isn\u2019t done.\u201d\nAccording to him, GPT-4V has been trained on a lot of different software interfaces and the underlying code bases, which unlocked new possibilities. \u201cWhen you show an interface, it understands the feature behind the button,\u201d Mercier said.\nUnlike Zapier and other automation products, Twin Labs doesn\u2019t rely on APIs and designing complicated multi-step processes. Instead, Twin Labs is more like a web browser. The tool can automatically load web pages, click on buttons and enter text.\nFor instance, if you\u2019re hiring someone, you might need to add this person\u2019s information in your payroll system, send an invitation to Slack, create a Google Workspace account and invite your new employee to create an account with the healthcare insurance provider.\nCompanies usually keep a long list of tasks and just go through the list every time there\u2019s a new team member. These tasks aren\u2019t complicated but it\u2019s extremely important to do them well, in the right order and with some specific checkboxes ticked. That\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be important to be able to train Twin Labs\u2019 AI assistant using screen recording and natural language descriptions.\nBut the startup isn\u2019t there yet \u2014 it is working toward this vision. Hugo Mercier and Joao Justi, the two co-founders, spent the last six months building a prototype of this product. They also raised $3 million in pre-seed funding from Betaworks, Motier Ventures and many angel investors, such as Florian Douetteau (Dataiku), Thomas Wolf (Hugging Face), Charles Gorintin (Alan), Mehdi Ghissassi (DeepMind), Romain Huet (OpenAI), Irwan Bello (OpenAI), Romuald Elie (DeepMind), Yan-David Erlich (Weights & Biases), Olivier Pomel (Datadog), Rodolphe Saad\u00e9 (CMA CGM), Thibaud Elziere (Hexa), Quentin Nickmans (Hexa), Philippe Corrot (Mirakl) and Rand Hindi (Snips, Zama).\nThere are still many challenges ahead for Twin Labs\u2019 autonomous agent system. For example, completing a task costs quite a bit of money \u2014 but API and infrastructure costs are rapidly going down in the AI space. Twin Labs will first ship a product with a library of pre-trained tasks to make sure that they work well. After that, the startup expects that it will open up its platform so that clients can create their own tasks.\nWhile many people associate AI products with a chatbot interface, Twin Labs\u2019 approach is interesting as it\u2019s an innovative way to interact with AI models. \u201cWe really wanted to get down to the nitty-gritty of what people do on a day-to-day basis, and how we can take over some of the things that are actually a bit of a hassle for them,\u201d Mercier said.\n",

An estimated 2.7 billion people work in an environment without regular access to a desk, a mobile phone, or a PC. And yet, shockingly, little technology is being designed for these frontline workers.\nMajor tech players, investors, and entrepreneurs focused relentlessly on workplace innovation for white-collar workers like themselves for decades. This has brought a revolution in the office for a narrow band of employees while leaving far too many rank-and-file workers behind who\u2019ve never been touched by what Bill Gates calls \u201cthe magic of software.\u201d\nA blue ocean market for \u201cIT that leaves no one behind\u201d\nIn 2015, I was part of the team that pioneered Workplace at Facebook, the company\u2019s first SaaS venture. Initially targeting knowledge workers and tech companies, we serendipitously stumbled upon the untapped \u201cfrontline tech\u201d market in 2016. This pivot proved strategic, amassing over 10 million paying users from renowned organizations like Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s, Kering, Leroy Merlin, Walmart, Lixil, and Petrobras. Our original underestimation of this market segment proved to be a blessing in disguise as we embraced the competitive void it presented. I witnessed firsthand the rising demand for connectivity among frontline-heavy organizations of all sizes. Moreover, I saw the tangible impact frontline-friendly software had on employee engagement, retention, and productivity.\nTech is on the cusp of a SaaS revolution for the 99%. Because this market is open and ready for disruption, I see an opportunity for savvy software entrepreneurs to build the Microsoft or the Salesforce of the frontline workers\u2019 world.\n \n\n\t\t\tI see an opportunity for savvy software entrepreneurs to build the Microsoft or the Salesforce of the frontline workers\u2019 world.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nConventional wisdom held that building products for these workers could have been more efficient and impracticable due to the restrictive nature of their working environments and IT budgets. Still, a confluence of trends is changing that mindset. Not only is it becoming clear that tech can improve conditions for these employees, but also there is a mounting sense of urgency that the benefits of SaaS workplace solutions must be extended to those who have been overlooked.\nThe pandemic brought into stark relief just how vital frontline employees (aka \u201ccritical workers\u201d) are for keeping our lives and economy moving in ways that we had taken for granted for far too long. They watched as white-collar employees at the central office received increased workplace flexibility while they continued to grind away.\nJohn Waldmann, the CEO of Homebase, a leader in the frontline tech space, told me, \u201ctwo-thirds of workers have not and will never work from home. The public conversation and technology investment are way over-indexed to hybrid work, which is your archetypal \u2018high class\u2019 problem affecting a limited number of workers. Everyone values flexibility, but for most workers, it means something entirely different \u2014 and technology can help.\u201d\nA recent Microsoft report on frontline tech noted that 51% of non-management employees don\u2019t feel valued, and more than 57% wish employers were doing more to address physical and mental exhaustion. A recent Beekeeper survey showed that four in 10 frontline workers have quit in the last year, and managers and head office staff don\u2019t know how to fix it.\n ",

      "content": "\nDuring today\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing focused on kids\u2019 online safety, X CEO Linda Yaccarino downplayed the social network\u2019s reach among younger users, when she noted that less than 1% of the app\u2019s U.S. users were teens ages 13 through 17. The executive put that number in context by also sharing that there were 90 million X users in the U.S. \u2014 a drop from its reported 95.4 million estimated users as of January 2023, according to data from Statista.\nWhen Elon Musk acquired Twitter, which has since rebranded as X, the U.S. was its largest market, ahead of Japan, India, Brazil and others. Speaking at an event last fall, Musk claimed the network overall had grown to 550 million monthly active users, though it wasn\u2019t clear if his calculations included fake accounts, like bots and spammers.\nThough Musk hadn\u2019t broken down X usage by market, at the time, Yaccarino last month indicated that X\u2019s user base overall was growing, noting that as of December 7, 2023, more than 10 million people had already signed up for X during the month.\nBut her figures shared with the U.S. Senate today suggest that X may be facing a slight year-over-year decline in the U.S., assuming the 2023 market estimates were accurate. (Statista noted they were based on addressable ad audiences and were provided by DataReportal.) A decline would align with market expectations, as a Pew Research study published in July 2023 found that a quarter of Twitter users said they were unlikely to be on the site in a year\u2019s time. Though Twitter, now X, has remained stickier than first thought, it has been facing a number of new competitors, including the decentralized network Mastodon, Bluesky and Instagram Threads, among others. Third-party data also indicated that X usage had dropped during Musk\u2019s first year of ownership, Axios reported in October.\nDespite the fact that X has come under fire for failing to take adequate measures to block CSAM (child sex abuse material) on its platform in markets including the EU and Australia,\u00a0has been sued by CSAM victims and last year unblocked the account of a user who had posted CSAM imagery, the company largely escaped deeper questions about its plans to combat CSAM during today\u2019s hearing. The lawmakers also didn\u2019t reference the recent Taylor Swift deepfake porn debacle, even though the news had reached the White House.\nIn addition to downplaying X\u2019s reach among young people, Yaccarino also distanced the company from its predecessor, Twitter, by calling X \u201ca 14-month-old company\u201d that has \u201creprioritized child protection and safety measures.\u201d She added that X has \u201cjust begun to talk about and discuss how we can enhance those [measures] with parental controls.\u201d\nTimed alongside the hearing, the company\u00a0shared that it suspended 12.4 million user accounts for violating its CSE (child sexual exploitation) policies in 2023, up from the 2.3 million accounts removed by Twitter in 2022. It also sent 850,000 reports to NCMEC (National Center for Missing & Exploited Children), eight times more than before Musk\u2019s acquisition.\nThose figures, of course, can be viewed in different ways \u2014 either that X has increased enforcement, as it wants people to believe, or that CSAM-related activity itself has increased on X, and an increase in the number of reports has followed.\nAlso during the hearing, Yaccarino answered a question about how many content moderators were on staff by saying that X had 2,300 people \u201call over the world.\u201d That\u2019s more than the number of X employees. (After Musk\u2019s acquisition, 80% of its workforce of 7,500 was laid off or quit, including most of the trust and safety team.) X recently said that it was planning to build back up its trust and safety teams by hiring 100 full-time moderators in Austin, Texas.\nIn an email response, a rep for X said it does have 2,300 people, as Yaccarino said, but they are a combination of full-time employees and full-time contractors.\n\nAhead of congressional hearing on child safety, X announces plans to hire 100 moderators in Austin\n\n",

      "title": "Threads is working on surfacing Trends, says Instagram head Adam Mosseri",
      "content": "\nInstagram Threads will adopt another Twitter/X feature: Trends, the company has confirmed. In a reply to a user on the app, Instagram head Adam Mosseri noted that work on such a feature was in the works, responding that \u201cwe are working on surfacing trends\u201d \u2014 a feature that would make the X rival even more competitive offering in terms of providing access to more real-time news and information.\nThreads, to date, has been criticized by some who felt the app\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d algorithm prioritized creators and posts from those they didn\u2019t follow and don\u2019t care about. It also often shows older posts, making the app feel stagnant. More recently, users complained that Threads was recommending low-quality content, which the company said it was fixing. Complaints around the algorithm\u2019s faults could potentially lessen with the launch of a Trends feature, as it would tap into the popular topics and discussions taking place on the app, giving people a new way to find interesting and relevant conversations.\n\u00a0\n\n\nPost by @mosseri\nView on Threads\n\n\u00a0\n\nTechCrunch previously reported that Threads was working on Trends last October after a\u00a0Threads user spotted the feature in a screenshot posted accidentally by an Instagram employee. At the time, the feature included a numbered list of trending topics as well as how many \u201cthreads\u201d were actively discussing each item.\nUnlike X\u2019s trends, Threads\u2019 Trends list that appeared in the leaked screenshot didn\u2019t appear to be accompanied by other trending lists by topic, like News, Sports, and Entertainment, or a list of Trends that are personalized to the end user, as are found on X. Instead, it showed a simple list of active discussions \u2014 like Disney+\u2019s release of \u201cLoki\u201d Season 2, for example, or Billboard\u2019s Latin Music Week, which were popular then.\nDespite user demand for Trends on Threads, the feature could be potentially problematic \u2014 especially if Trends are algorithmically curated, instead of being curated by human editors or with human oversight. Bad actors could take advantage of a trends feature to make a certain topic or tag go viral, even if it\u2019s inappropriate or toxic. Spammers could also use a trends feature to flood a topic with their unwanted posts. Given that Threads is still managed by a small team, relative to Meta\u2019s size, introducing Trends to Threads adds another layer of complexity to the app, and another surface for potential harm.\nMosseri didn\u2019t say when Trends would launch on Threads, but a screenshot from reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi showed a different version of Trends that had been renamed as \u201cToday\u2019s Topics.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how Trends will look when it launches publicly, however.\n",

      "content": "\nNearly two months after Castro, the third-party podcast app, announced it was seeking new ownership, the company revealed today that it has officially been bought by Bluck Apps, an independent app studio that developed Android podcast app Aurelian.\nIn November, Castro\u2019s future was questioned when a former employee, Mohit Mamoria, posted on X that the app would soon shut down. Then the website went down, appearing to confirm the report. However, Castro disputed the claim and explained the reason behind the app\u2019s downtime in a December blog post, saying it was due to a complex issue that required \u201cextensive work\u201d to fix.\nDustin Bluck, a former Instagram employee who launched his podcast app Aurelian as a passion project, now runs the show at Castro, and promises users there are no plans to make any significant changes to the app.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be making any drastic changes, like overhauling the UI to look more like TikTok. We\u2019re not adding an AI chatbot. We\u2019ll just keep running the podcast service you already love, with a few tweaks to modernize and keep things running smoothly,\u201d Bluck wrote in today\u2019s blog post, adding that the minor tweaks should help new episodes \u201csync more quickly.\u201d\n\u201cOnce things are stabilized and the transition is complete, we\u2019ll be turning our attention toward new features, such as syncing across devices,\u201d he explained.\nAs an indie developer, Bluck wants to make sure Castro still serves dedicated podcast listeners. \u201cThis is a niche, and we intend to serve that niche. If you have over 100 podcast subscriptions and listen to them all semi-regularly, you are probably one of our people,\u201d Bluck said.\nBluck assured users that the subscription price is staying the same for the time being; however, users should subscribe to \u201cCastro Plus\u201d now to avoid a future price hike. Castro is free for users but offers an annual subscription for $29.99, including playback features and other advanced settings like skipping repetitive intros.\nMeanwhile, Aurelian is being moved under the Castro umbrella and will use Castro\u2019s back end for search and other capabilities. However, Bluck tells TechCrunch that Aurelian isn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily merging with Castro,\u201d but would consider them as siblings.\n\u201cIt might become Castro, but I wouldn\u2019t want to call it Castro until it actually fits into Castro\u2019s Inbox/Queue workflow. I\u2019m not yet sure if we\u2019ll do that,\u201d Bluck tells us.\nBluck declined to share how much he paid for Castro.\nCastro\u2019s new owner also apologized for how the company previously failed to communicate well with users in recent months. From now on, all major changes will be announced to the public, and the team will let users know in a timely manner if/when an issue is being fixed.\nBluck definitely has his work cut out for him as he points out the \u201cthousands of messages\u201d from users that he and his very small team have to get through. While Bluck has hired a couple freelancers, he\u2019s the only full-time employee as of now, so it will likely take some time before he can hire more people to help.\nCastro has been a popular iOS podcast app for years, so it\u2019s likely a relief to many that it\u2019s not going anywhere. The app was acquired by Tiny back in 2018.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really expect people to be quite so passionate about the app. There\u2019s a lot of work to do to make those fans happy, but the reception has been very encouraging,\u201d Bluck admitted. \u201cWe are very committed to the open podcasting ecosystem, and taking over such a well-designed independent app is very cool for us.\u201d\n\nRIP? Third-party podcast app Castro appears to be dead, company goes quiet\n\n",

      "content": "\nIn today\u2019s congressional online safety hearing, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg again pushed back at the idea that businesses like his should be responsible for managing parental consent systems for kids\u2019 use of social media apps, like Facebook and Instagram. Instead, he suggested the problem should be dealt with by the app store providers, like Apple and Google, he said.\nThis is not the first time Meta has floated the idea. Last November, the company introduced a proposal that argued that Apple and Google should do more with regard to kids\u2019 and teens\u2019 safety by requiring parental approval when users aged 13 to 15 download certain apps.\nAt the time, Meta\u2019s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said this would be the \u201cbest way\u201d to support both parents and kids, and the solution should be enacted \u201cindustry-wide,\u201d where \u201call apps are held to the same, consistent standard,\u201d according to a report by The Washington Post at the time.\nIn other words, Meta wants to ensure that the playing field between it and its competitors remains level, despite the massive size of its social networking services, which, combined, are used by 3.14 billion people daily, as of the company\u2019s Q3 2023 earnings announced in October. That\u2019s larger than Snapchat\u2019s 406 million daily active users, as of Q3, or X\u2019s reported 500 million+ monthly active users.\u00a0\nIn today\u2019s hearing, Zuckerberg suggested that Meta\u2019s own research indicated that parents wanted more control over apps via smartphones and the app stores that families use.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think parents should have to upload an ID to prove that they\u2019re the parent of a child in every single app that their children use,\u201d he said, positioning his proposal as one that would better respect user privacy as ID uploads would not be involved.\n\u201cAnd a place where it\u2019d be actually very easy for it to work is within the app stores themselves \u2014 where my understanding is Apple and Google already \u2014 or at least Apple already \u2014 requires parental consent when a child does a payment with an app,\u201d Zuckerberg noted, a subtle jab at Apple\u2019s requirement that apps on its platform use its own payment methods. \u201cSo it should be pretty trivial to pass a law that requires them to make it so parents have control anytime a child downloads an app and offers consent to that,\u201d he said.\nHis suggestion is a clever maneuver by Meta, as it effectively turns Apple\u2019s desire to profit from the apps on its app stores against them. Today, Apple takes a 15% to 30% commission on all in-app purchases that take place through iOS apps, depending on the business\u2019s size and other factors. Or, simply put, Meta is saying that if Apple wants to be the payment processor for all iOS apps, at a cost to Meta\u2019s profits, then parental consent over app usage should be Apple\u2019s problem, too.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the type of legislation, in addition to some of the other ideas that you all have, that would make this a lot easier for parents,\u201d Zuckerberg added.\nMeta and Apple have been at odds for some time, following Apple\u2019s entry into the advertising market, which it did by way of a privacy measure for consumers, App Tracking Transparency. With this, consumers could request apps not to track them, hurting Meta\u2019s advertising business and revenues. In turn, app makers would have to buy more App Store Search ads to target their users.\n\u00a0\n",

The new feature, which was unveiled earlier this month, lets users search from anywhere on their phone using gestures like circling, highlighting, scribbling or tapping.\nThe tech giant believes the new feature aims to make it more natural to engage with Google Search whenever a question pops into your head, like when you\u2019re watching a video or looking at an image on a social app. For example, if you\u2019re watching a video where someone is eating a Korean corn dog, you could circle the corn dog and ask, \u201cWhy are these so popular?\u201d\nImage Credits: Google\nThe feature can be engaged through other gestures, as well, not just circles. If you\u2019re chatting in a messaging app with a friend about a restaurant, you could simply tap on the name of the restaurant to see more details about it without having to leave the app.\nCircle to Search also makes it easier to look up definitions of words or phrases. Say you\u2019re watching a video featuring a drink with the word \u201cprebiotic\u201d on it, but you don\u2019t know what it means or how it\u2019s different from \u201cprobiotic.\u201d In the past, you would have to leave whichever app you\u2019re using and go to your browser to search for the word. Now, you can long-press the home button or navigation bar to activate Circle to Search and highlight \u201cprebiotic\u201d to learn more about it. When you\u2019re done, you just need to swipe away and resume the video.\nWith Circle to Search, you will be able to access search from any app, which means you no longer have to stop what you\u2019re doing to start a search in your browser. Plus, if you\u2019re someone who takes a screenshot to remind yourself to search something later, you no longer have to do that as you can search right away without interrupting what you\u2019re currently doing.\n\nGoogle introduces \u2018Circle to Search,\u2019 a new way to search from anywhere on Android using gestures\n\n",

      "content": "\nDating app giant Match Group says it hasn\u2019t yet determined how it plans to adapt its products in light of the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a new regulation that is forcing Apple to open up its platform to alternative app stores, third-party payments and more. Speaking to investors during the company\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings call this morning, Match President and CEO Gary Swidler noted that, like other companies including Spotify and Microsoft, there are questions and concerns with Apple\u2019s response to the legislation, but added that Match hasn\u2019t yet decided if it would opt into Apple\u2019s new rules.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still considering what this all means,\u201d Swidler said. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at it, making sure we understand it,\u201d he explained.\nApple announced last week a host of complicated rules around how it\u2019s complying with the DMA, which involve a new commission structure for apps distributed in the EU, including separate fees for the use of Apple\u2019s in-app payments and a new \u201cCore Technology Fee\u201d that applies to any business opting into the new rules. Alternately, app developers can choose to stay on the same system they are today, where they simply pay Apple a commission for in-app purchases that range from 15% to 30%, depending on the company size and other factors.\nIn doing the math, several large companies realized Apple\u2019s DMA rules wouldn\u2019t actually provide them the discounts they had hoped for in an open app marketplace, where they could process their own payments and distribute apps outside the App Store. That\u2019s led to backlash from notable Apple critics, including Epic Games and Spotify, as well as others like Mozilla and Microsoft. Match is likely going to come to the same conclusion that the rules are not as favorable to their business as they had wanted them to be.\nHowever, Swidler noted there was the potential for the rules to change because, even though Apple had proposed new rules for its App Store and iOS platform, the European Commission still actually has to accept its proposal.\n\u201cAnd that, in and of itself, is far from assured,\u201d Swidler added. \u201cAnd so I think that will continue to play itself out over the next weeks or months as we get to that March 6 deadline.\u201d\nIn addition, Match believes the fact that the new regulations are available to EU users could put pressure on other markets, like the U.S., to adopt similar measures.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a consumer in the U.S., or you\u2019re a consumer in the U.K. \u2014 right next door to the EU \u2014 you start to wonder why our customers in the EU are getting benefits and we\u2019re not getting the same benefits. So if you\u2019re the government in those jurisdictions, you\u2019d say, well, our citizens deserve the same benefits as what we\u2019re seeing in the EU.\u201d\nMatch has a relatively small percentage of its revenue in the U.K. that comes from iOS, the CEO noted, but it has a lot more revenue coming from the U.K. and North America, where similar laws regulating app stores would benefit the dating app maker, if they came to pass.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to see where this goes because we\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time. And this is the first, tangible movement that we\u2019ve seen from the the regulators,\u201d Swidler said. He said Match estimated it could save $20 million in app store fees in the EU in the future.\nMatch\u2019s earnings on Tuesday came out ahead of estimates with earnings of $0.81 per share, up from $0.30 per share a year ago. The company also posted revenues of $866.23 million for the quarter ending in December, up from $786.15 a year ago. For the full year, Match reported record revenue, up 6% year-over-year, to $3.4 billion.\n\nEpic Games CEO calls out Apple\u2019s DMA rules as \u2018malicious compliance\u2019 and full of \u2018junk fees\u2019\n\n\nSpotify calls Apple\u2019s DMA compliance plan \u2018extortion\u2019 and a \u2018complete and total farce\u2019\n\n\nApple\u2019s answer to EU\u2019s gatekeeper rules is new \u2018core tech\u2019 fee for apps\n\n",

The lens will overlay the song title, artist name, cover art and a link to listen to the track on Spotify.\nTo get started with the feature, you first need to make sure your Spotify and Snapchat mobile apps are updated. Then, you need to select a track on Spotify that you want to share. You can then open the share menu and hit the Snapchat \u201cLens\u201d icon. The lens will then generate the track information on Snapchat. After you create your Snap, you can share it to your Story or with others.\nImage Credits: Spotify\nAlthough Snapchat users have had the ability to share what they\u2019re listening to on Spotify since 2019, you couldn\u2019t do so while capturing yourself or your surroundings, as you could only share a Snap with the song\u2019s title and artist. This new feature lets you share a song alongside an image, in a way that\u2019s similar to sharing songs in Instagram Stories.\nFor instance, if you and your friends are listening to a song while getting ready to go out, you can take a Snap of yourselves and overlay the track you\u2019re listening to on top. Or, you can use the feature when you\u2019re at the beach and listening to a song while looking at the waves and want to capture the entire vibe.\nThe new feature is rolling out globally starting today for both Android and iOS users in markets where both Spotify and Snapchat are available.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s your signature song or a new single you can\u2019t stop playing on repeat, the music you love to listen to is a part of who you are,\u201d Spotify wrote in a blog post. \u201cAnd we know Spotify users regularly share the music they\u2019re loving with friends, as the number of songs shared to social media platforms grow each year.

We\u2019ve already seen some startups in this space and today, Tel Aviv-based Aim Security is joining the fray with a new GenAI security platform and a $10 million seed funding round. This round was led by YL Ventures, with participation from Cyber Club London and a group of angel investors that includes the founders of WIZ.\nLike so many Israeli security startups, Aim Security\u2019s founders Matan Getz (CEO) and Adir Gruss (CTO) got their cybersecurity education during their time with the Israel Defense Forces. Getz spent time with Unit 8200 and became the deputy CISO at the IDF, while Gruss was the commander of what Getz described as an \u201celite cybersecurity education program.\u201d After his time with the army, Gruss became the field CTO of Laminar.\nImage Credits: Aim Security\n\u201cWe partnered together for my internal projects [at the IDF] and then when GenAI became hyped and not just for the geeks, we quickly understood the power of GenAI. This was exactly the time when we decided to partner and to found Aim Security,\u201d Getz told me.\nGetz explained that the company wants to take a holistic look at the security implications of GenAI, most of which revolve around preventing data leakage and ensuring that GenAI usage \u2014 both by employees who use public GenAI products like ChatGPT and by developers who may create their own internal or public-facing applications \u2014 doesn\u2019t leak private data.\n\u201cThe consumer applications that are out there are very easy to use. It\u2019s like to call it [Data Loss Prevention] on steroids because now you have an interest to upload sensitive data and the applications have a deep interest to train their models on that data,\u201d Getz said. Meanwhile, many large companies have started connecting their internal data to copilots (mostly from Microsoft), making it hard for them to enforce their existing authorization rules, all while the internal developers are looking to build their own homegrown applications.\nThe company\u2019s platform integrates with a lot of existing security solutions but it also offers a lightweight browser extension. This way, the company always sits between the large language model and the user (or application) and knows exactly which GenAI tools a company\u2019s employees are using and what data they feed them.\nGetz noted that the company is already seeing a lot of traction across a number of industries. With investors who have deep roots in both the U.S. and Europe, the company has now set its sights to expand in these markets.\n\nPrompt Security wants to make GenAI safe for the enterprise\n\n",

      "content": "\nWhen people hear the term \u201cidentity management\u201d in an enterprise context, they typically think of apps that help users authenticate who they are on a network in order to access certain services. In a security context, however, human users are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to managing access and making sure it doesn\u2019t get breached.\nA whole, considerably more complex, universe of machine-based authentications underpin how just about everything IT works with everything else \u2014 a universe that is arguably considerably even more vulnerable to hacking simply because of that size and complexity, with some 50 \u201cnon-human\u201d identities for every human typically in an organization, and sometimes more. Today, a startup out of Israel called Oasis Security is emerging from stealth with technology that it has built to address this.\nIt\u2019s coming out of stealth only today but has already raised funding and acquired customers while still under the radar. The fast-casual food chain Chipotle, property firm JLL and Mercury Financial are among its early users.\nThe funding, meanwhile, speaks to the early enthusiasm from investors. Led by Sequoia (specifically Doug Leone and Bogomil Balkansky); Accel, Cyberstarts, Maple Capital, Guy Podjarny (founder of Snyk) and Michael Fey (co-founder and CEO of enterprise browser startup Island) also participated across two different rounds that are being announced today: a $5 million seed and a $35 million Series A.\nSidenote on the funding: One investor mentioned Oasis to me months ago, describing the jockeying among VCs to back the still-unlaunched Oasis as an \u201cincredible frenzy.\u201d\nThe crux of what Oasis is tackling is the fact that non-human identity \u2014 which covers not just how two apps may interact together by way of an authentication, but also how two machines or any processes might work in tandem in an organization \u2014 may have become an amorphous but essential aspect of how modern businesses work today. But because so much of it does not involve people at all, there is a strong lack of visibility around how much of it works, including when it doesn\u2019t work.\nHuman identity management is already fertile ground for bad actors, who use phishing and many other techniques to catch people off guard, to steal their identities and use them to essentially worm their way into networks. Oasis\u2019 founder and CEO Danny Brickman says that non-human identity is very much the next frontier for those bad actors.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re just playing the statistics game, if it\u2019s true that identity is the new perimeter when it comes to security, then this is the new risk for organizations,\u201d he said in an interview in London. \u201cIf you have 50 times more non-human identities than human ones, that means the attack surface is 50 times larger.\u201d For CISOs, he added, how to handle non-human identities \u201cis top of mind right now.\u201d\nTo tackle this, Oasis has built a three-part system, which in its most simplest terms can be described as \u201cdiscover, resolve, automate.\u201d\nThe first of these builds and tracks a full picture of how a network looks and operates, and creates, essentially, a giant recreation of all the places where machines or any non-human identities interface with each other. It describes this as a visualized map.\nIt can then use this map to track what data moves around where, and when it appears that something is not working as it should. That might or might not be related to an authentication: It could also relate to how data moves through a system once it\u2019s authenticated. In both cases, Oasis then provides remediation suggestions to respond to anything unusual. As with many remediation solutions, these suggestions can be carried out automatically or triaged by humans.\nThe third part is the proactive continuing work: an automated refresh of the map and the ongoing observation around it.\nBrickman\u2019s track record is as elusive as the threat that his startup is aiming to contain, but the basics of it give some clue as to why investors were willing to give him money before the product even launched, and why the startup is able to sign on users so early on.\nHe spent more than seven years in the Israeli Defense Forces, where he worked in cybersecurity. There, he tells me he led a team that identified and then fixed a major problem in the military.\nWhat was that problem, and how was it fixed? Brickman wouldn\u2019t say, no matter how many ways I asked him.\nLeading a team of engineers, he said, \u201cWe worked in a basement. Nobody knew about our project. We didn\u2019t want to lose momentum.\u201d Eventually, they had a breakthrough, and they won an innovation prize awarded by the head of the army for the work. Which no one still knows about, it seems.\nIt was through that work that Brickman met many other engineers, including Amit Zimmerman, who became his co-collaborator on that secret, award-winning project and is now his co-founder at Oasis, where he is the chief product officer.\nThere are a number of companies that are now focusing on the challenge of tracking non-human, machine-to-machine authentication and identity management. One of them, another Israeli startup called Silverfort, just last week announced a big funding round of its own. Silverfort is taking a big-picture approach to the problem, including human identity as part of its bigger remit: Its premise is that the two continue to be inextricably linked, so one must consider them simultaneously in order to truly secure a system.\nThis is not something that Oasis wants to look at, for now at least. True to its name, it thinks that there is something salient and distinct and ultimately more lucrative in definitively quantifying and solving the myriad problems in the non-human space first.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on non-human identity,\u201d Brickman said. \u201cWe want to drive the value from there.\u201d\n\u201cIdentity is the new perimeter, and non-human identity is the gaping hole in that perimeter,\u201d said Balkansky at Sequoia Capital in a statement. \u201cWe are excited to work with the Oasis team to solve one of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity today. The company has come out of the gate very strong and fast, signing up blue chip customers less than a year after it was founded, which is a testament to the latent demand for such a solution and to this team\u2019s capabilities and commitment.\u201d\n",

      "content": "\nIndependent restaurant owners used to heavily rely on foot traffic as their way of marketing. In 2020, the global pandemic changed all that.\nOvernight, restaurants needed to set up online ordering, have a plan for pick-up and delivery and find new ways to get in front of customers no longer going out to eat.\nInspired by his mother\u2019s struggles to attract customers to her dog grooming business, Adam Guild teamed up with Dean Bloembergen to create Owner.com to help independent restaurant owners better manage their online presence.\n\u201cPeople are hurting worse than ever in the restaurant industry because the inflation has created rising labor costs and rising food costs,\u201d Guild told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s compressing the already low profit margins of these restaurant owners, so it is more important to them than ever to figure out ways to increase sales and save money.\u201d\nTo that end, Owner.com offers an all-in-one platform for restaurants that includes online ordering, a website builder, customer relationship management tools, marketing automation and a branded mobile app generator.\n\nOwner.com whips up new tools for independent restaurants following funding\n\nRestaurant sales were poised to reach sales of $997 billion in 2023, according to the National Restaurant Association. That provides huge opportunities for companies like Owner.com, Guild said.\nThere\u2019s also room for other startups to leverage technology with tools focused on mom-and-pop restaurants. Last year, Superorder raised $10 million to help restaurants with their online presence, and there are dozens of companies with operations tools to manage both the front and back of the house, including Zitti, MarginEdge,\u00a0OneOrder\u00a0and TouchBistro.\nTo differentiate itself more, Owner.com recently tapped into artificial intelligence for new features, including an email marketer. As he described it, restaurant owners can start typing in a sentence of what they want the email to say or do. For example, \u201cTell my customers about my new yellow curry,\u201d and the AI will produce an email for them designed in their style, written in their tone and ready to go out to customers.\nToday, the company has thousands of customers after tripling the number in the past year. Owner processes hundreds of millions of dollars annually for its customers and yields tens of millions in revenue, Guild said.\nDean Bloembergen and Adam Guild, co-founders of Owner.com. Image Credits: Owner.com\nTechCrunch has followed Owner.com as it attracted $10.7 million in seed funding, led by SaaStr Fund, then $15 million in Series A capital led by Altman Capital.\nNow the company has raised $33 million in Series B funding on a $200 million post-money valuation, Guild said. Existing investors Redpoint Ventures and Altman Capital co-led the round, with participation from Horsley Bridge, Activant Capital and Transpose Platform Management. Total capital raised is now $58.7 million.\nGuild expects to continue investing in engineering teams and design teams to cater to what his customers are saying they need. In addition to the AI-powered email marketer, there are other tools in the pipeline.\n\u201cEven just five years ago, it used to be enough to provide great food and great service because those things are hard to do on their own,\u201d Guild said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer enough if you want to be a successful restaurant. More of the guest experience has shifted online, even where people discover restaurants. Large corporations can afford to spend billions of dollars on teams of engineers and marketers and ad spend. Independent restaurant owners are being screwed over. What we are building is to help these mom-and-pop owners not only survive as a result of this technological change, but continue to thrive as more of their business goes online.\u201d\n\nAs startups whip up a restaurant tech frenzy, is anyone close to Toast?\n\n",

      "content": "\nThe Reserve Bank of India is discussing more penalties on Paytm Payments Bank and may reach a decision within days, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch, as troubles mount for the Indian financial services firm that serves more than 330 million customers.\nThe central bank has internally discussed revoking the payments bank license of Paytm, the sources said, requesting anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to the press. RBI didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment early Thursday.\nIn one of its strongest worded letters, the RBI on Wednesday ordered new curbs on Paytm Payments Bank, virtually ensuring that the Payments Bank no longer operates most of its businesses in less than six weeks.\nIn 2022, RBI slapped Paytm Payments Bank with penalties after finding that the Noida-headquartered firm had violated rules by allowing data to flow to servers outside of India and didn\u2019t properly verify its customers. RBI said Wednesday a comprehensive audit by external auditors found \u201cpersistent\u201d noncompliances and \u201ccontinued material supervisory concerns\u201d in the bank. The noncompliance, RBI said, warranted \u201cfurther supervisory action.\u201d\nThe decision follows the central bank summoning two Paytm officials to its office in recent weeks over compliance issues, one source said.\nPaytm said on Thursday that it will stop working with Paytm Payments Bank and explore tie-ups with other banks for many of its financial services. A payments bank license allows the holder to offer basic banking services such as accepting customer deposits of up to $2,400. Paytm \u201cwill be working only with other banks, and not with Paytm Payments Bank Limited,\u201d the firm disclosed to the stock exchange Thursday.\nShares of Paytm fell 20% within minutes of marketing opening Thursday, hitting the lower circuit that halted trading for the day. Paytm share ended trading at 608.8 Indian rupees, or $7.3, less than two thirds of its issue price.\nThe RBI\u2019s notice has sent shockwaves through the Indian fintech industry, which has already been hit with several regulatory clarifications in recent years. In December, Paytm said it would issue fewer personal loans under 50,000 Indian rupees ($600) after the RBI tightened norms for consumer loans and publicly expressed concerns about the bad, tiny personal loans.\nMacquarie analysts, known for the best calls on Paytm, said: \u201cWe have seen RBI take ~15 months time to revoke its ban on digital business activities of the largest private sector bank. However, in this case since the first ban (in March 2022) for onboarding new customers (~22 months have lapsed), RBI has conducted a comprehensive IT audit and continued to identify non-compliance, which in our view indicates that these lapses are quite material.\u201d\nOne97 Communications, the parent firm of Paytm, owns a 49% stake in Payment Payments Bank whereas rest equity is owned by Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma.

The payment bank houses 330 million wallet accounts and 30 million bank accounts.\nShares of Paytm fell 20% within minutes of market opening on Thursday, hitting the circuit breaker.\nThe RBI issued stringent new restrictions on Wednesday on Paytm Payments Bank, which processes transactions for Paytm, effectively ending the bank\u2019s operations by barring it from providing many banking services, including accepting fresh deposits and enabling credit transactions. It also asked Paytm and Paytm Payments Bank to terminate their nodal accounts.

With interest rates at such high levels, Bharuka wanted to take advantage of the environment \u2014 however, banks were giving pennies on the dollar, he told TechCrunch.\n\u201cWith the high interest rates, you basically earn free money on idle cash through U.S. Treasury Bills. But, there is no easy way to buy Treasury Bills today,\u201d Bharuka said. \u201cYou can buy them through the government website, Treasury Direct, which is an experience from the 1990s, or use the legacy brokerages like Fidelity or Charles Schwab. Those experiences are often opaque, and come with a clunky user experience. Most modern fintech apps also don\u2019t enable you to invest in underlying fixed-income assets.\u201d\nHe was part of the Winter 2023 Y Combinator cohort, however, Bharuka initially went in with a logistics-focused company for India. He ended up pivoting when he noticed the pain points associated with buying Treasury Bills.\nHe and his team are developing Finvest to make the purchase, management and selling of U.S. Treasury Bills seamless. Pershing Advisor Solutions LLC, a subsidiary of the Bank of New York Mellon Corp., serves as the brokerage firm.\nFinvest\u2019s investment app features. Image Credits: Get Moving\nHere\u2019s how it works: After downloading either the iOS or Android app, users create an account, add a bank account and initiate a deposit. Typically, there is a one-day verification process for creating a brokerage account. However, Finvest enables the deposit to be teed up so that once the account is approved, the trade will start going through.\nFinvest charges a flat management fee of 0.03% per month on the average daily market value of your Treasury assets and monthly management fees.\nBharuka is not alone in wanting to make this process easier. Zamp Finance, backed by Sequoia, provides a treasury management platform for better access to U.S. Treasury Bills. Finvest sweetens its offering with a high-yield cash management account that gives you a 4.4% yield, higher than most savings accounts.\nThe company is in its earliest stages, with Bharuka declining to say how many customers have downloaded the app, but did say that around $1 million in deposits were made since launching in December.\nIt also already grabbed $2.7 million in funding from an investor group that includes Bayhouse Capital, Unpopular Ventures, Y Combinator, Olive Tree Capital, Pioneer Fund, Fractal Ventures and a group of angel investors, including former Airbnb executive Oliver Jung.\nBharuka plans to use the funding to expand Get Moving\u2019s engineering team and eventually add other asset classes to the Finvest app, for example, corporate bonds and municipal bonds.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also planning to launch this internationally as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been exploring this angle because there is a lot of interest to invest into treasuries, especially in Latin countries, like Argentina or Brazil, because their economic economies have not been that strong. They want to invest in a stronger economy, but there is no direct way to do it today.\u201d\n\nRobinhood\u2019s decision to limit crypto trading makes good sense\n\n",

      "title": "Despite glimmers of profit, most African neobanks remain in the red",
      "content": "\nIt was only just over a year ago that McKinsey described Africa\u2019s financial technology landscape as a \u201chotbed for investment.\u201d Fast-forward to today and startups on the continent are facing many of the same problems plaguing fintechs in more mature markets like the U.K. and the U.S.: Valuations are tanking, growth is flagging, revenue targets are being missed and those investors are, well, searching for a rest in another hotbed. But look a little closer, and there are some glimmers of hope amid the bigger challenges.\nTymeBank, the South African digital bank majority owned by African billionaire Patrice Motsepe\u2019s African Rainbow Capital, recently announced it became profitable for the first time in the month of December 2023.\nTo be clear, celebrations might be as short-lived as the bank\u2019s profit run: TymeBank did not disclose revenue or other financials, and in fact it has only confirmed profit for that month alone \u2014 not the full year. The situation underscores the problem facing many fintech companies in Africa: despite the huge growth potential, sustained profit remains elusive for many of these businesses.\nStill, the neobank now is strategically using the profit moment to curry more traction with investors. TymeBank has had a couple of mega funding rounds over the last two years, and the last of these apparently valued the startup at $965 million, according to a January report from Bloomberg. That report quoted CEO Coenraad Jonker, who said the startup was looking to raise another $100 million, valuing the company at over $1 billion.\nThe startup \u2014 which operates as an independent entity under parent company Tyme Group and alongside sister company GoTyme based in the Philippines \u2014 has 8.5 million users in South Africa. But while it\u2019s still acquiring users \u2014 150,000 users per month as of January 2024 \u2014 that figure does appear to be slowing: In 2023, TymeBank said its acquisition rate was 200,000 users each month.\nTymeBank claims it is the first digital bank to break even not just in South Africa but on the whole continent. This may not be completely accurate. In the past, Nigerian fintechs Carbon and FairMoney have claimed profitability across entire financial years, no less.\nCarbon publicly disclosed financials in 2018 and 2019, reporting profits exceeding $700,000 cumulatively. After a two-year hiatus, Carbon resumed financial disclosures, revealing a net income of N201 million ($478,500) for the financial year ending June 30, 2022. Similarly, FairMoney posted a profit after tax exceeding N1.6 billion ($3.9 million) for the financial year ending December 31, 2021. Both of these have been conspicuously silent in more recent times, though.\n\nWhy this Nigerian fintech startup is volunteering audited financials\n\nWhat makes a neobank profitable?\nAs we wrote recently, deposit-led digital bank Kuda is among the fintechs chasing profit. Kuda is hinging its own shift on scaling its overdraft and introducing more micro-lending products. The message has been clear for many fintechs like Kuda: neobanks have not managed to turn a profit on consumer deposits alone, so introducing lending products is critical.\nThis is not entirely new and, in fact, mirrors a lot of neobank development elsewhere. In the U.K., Starling Bank turned profitable through a two-pronged strategy of building strong deposit and lending portfolios aided by a high-interest rate environment.\nAfrica\u2019s neobanks have taken different paths to get to the same place. FairMoney and Carbon began as online lenders offering instant loans and bill payments before providing accounts and cards. TymeBank, similar to Kuda, initially focused on delivering zero-to-low-fee bank accounts and savings products before venturing into credit services.\nIn 2022, TymeBank acquired Retail Capital as its business banking arm to complement MoreTyme, its buy now, pay later product for consumers. This acquisition alone provided more than R10 billion (~$507 million) in working capital to small and medium enterprises, and that activity contributed to TymeBank\u2019s 30% year-on-year growth in its lending portfolio. Meanwhile, FairMoney, lacking sizable deposits, turned to Nigeria\u2019s capital markets, launching a private note program worth N10 billion ($23 million) to support its loan book growth and short-term liquidity needs. Carbon, having raised $5 million in debt in 2019, notes that its deposits constitute over 40% of its loan book.\n\nStarling\u2019s results are more proof that high interest rates could be a boon for fintech\n\nThese examples highlight the importance of stable balance sheets and a robust lending proposition for neobanks to achieve profitability. Yet, it\u2019s crucial to note that African neobanks are still predominantly loss-making entities. TymeBank\u2019s recent announcement of profitability, for instance, followed financials for the year ending June 30, 2023, revealing accumulated losses of R6.6 billion ($351 million) up to that point.\nInterestingly, Carbon, raising the least funding out of all of these \u2014 $15 million compared to FairMoney\u2019s and Kuda\u2019s $90 million+ and TymeBank\u2019s $250 million+ \u2014 has been in the black shorter than any of these (hitting profits in three out five years). It\u2019s the smallest as a business, though, with over 3 million users compared to FairMoney\u2019s 6 million, Kuda\u2019s 7 million and TymeBank\u2019s 8.5 million.\nBad loans weigh on neobanks\nOne of the more significant issues that has weighed on how neobanks have performed in Africa has been the impact of bad debt.\nIn the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, TymeBank reported a net loss of R976 million ($57.5 million). However, by the close of fiscal 2023, its losses fell by 20.7% to R858 million ($45.6 million). Its December 2023 result was primarily driven by significant growth in net interest income and fees and commission incomes, which rose by 109% and 360%, respectively, reaching $28.2 million and $18 million from fiscal 2022. This robust performance contributed to TymeBank\u2019s top-line revenue, which surged by 62% to $48.5 million in fiscal 2023.\nHowever, TymeBank\u2019s revenue growth didn\u2019t come without a cost. TymeBank\u2019s credit impairment charge, representing loans that customers couldn\u2019t repay or deemed as bad loans, saw a substantial increase. This charge, which was a modest $65,000 in 2022, dramatically surged by 20,000% to $13 million in 2023, impacting the neobank\u2019s net revenues, which settled at $35.5 million. Concurrently, the fintech\u2019s operating expenses, covering staffing, depreciation and other operating costs, increased by 9% to $81 million.\n\nSouth African challenger bank TymeBank raises $77.8M from Norrsken22 and Blue Earth Capital\n\nAs for FairMoney, despite turning a profit in 2021 with a net income of N1.6 billion ($3.9 million), the Tiger Global-backed fintech faced challenges in 2022, ending the year with N3.73 billion ($8.3 million) in losses.\nThe vicissitude was influenced by a 67% increase in operating expenses, from $18.6 million in 2021 to $31 million in 2022. And though FairMoney\u2019s top-line revenues experienced substantial growth, reaching $123 million, an 82% increase from 2021, the impact of impaired loans, surging by 138% to $101 million, weighed down its net revenue for the year to approximately $22 million.\nComparing its fiscal 2022 net revenue with the $400-500 million valuation commanded after securing a bridge round last year, FairMoney\u2019s revenue multiple ranges from 18-22x. On the other hand, TymeBank\u2019s revenue multiple in fiscal 2023 was 27x at its current $965 million valuation. Like Kuda\u2019s 25x revenue multiple in 2022, these multiples are considered expensive in the current fintech market.\nWhile growing into these valuations is an ongoing process, an immediate focus for these neobanks should be addressing credit impairment challenges. In 2022, FairMoney\u2019s net impairment accounted for 82% of its net interest income, compared to TymeBank\u2019s 47% in 2023; for the latter, a 200x increase from the year before should be a concern. An increase in credit loss expense reflects growth in both neobanks\u2019 lending portfolios, however, TymeBank and FairMoney need to strengthen their credit quality amidst ongoing economic headwinds like currency devaluations and lower purchasing power and adjust their models to consider higher loss expectations from their customers across South Africa and Nigeria.\nMeanwhile, in the fiscal year 2023, Carbon grappled with credit impairment issues and Nigeria\u2019s currency devaluation (the Naira depreciated by 49% year-to-date) and thus, couldn\u2019t maintain its profitability that year. Conversely, in a profitable fiscal 2022, the Lendable-backed fintech had reduced credit impairment by 67% compared to the preceding year and reported approximately $6 million in net revenues. On the other hand, FairMoney said it reached profitability for the fiscal year 2023.\nUpdated to include new information on FairMoney\u2019s profitability status in 2023. The fintech also claimed that 2022 was its only loss-making year since its first full audit year in 2018. \u00a0\nGot a news tip or inside information about a topic we covered?

      "content": "\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) widened its curbs on Paytm\u2019s Payments Bank, which processes transactions for financial services giant Paytm, barring it from offering many banking services, including accepting fresh deposits and credit transactions across its services.\nWednesday\u2019s move, which goes into effect February 29, follows the Indian central bank ordering Paytm Payments Bank to stop accepting new customer accounts in 2022, a curb it maintains. RBI said a comprehensive audit by external auditors found \u201cpersistent\u201d noncompliances and \u201ccontinued material supervisory concerns\u201d in the bank. The noncompliance, RBI said, warranted \u201cfurther supervisory action.\u201d\nThe full extent of RBI\u2019s new direction remains unclear for now, but industry executives cautioned that it could severely disrupt Paytm\u2019s offline merchant business as well as the gateway business. RBI\u2019s new directive \u201cfor all practical purposes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0ends the operations of Paytm Payments Bank,\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote in a note. \u201cThis is a definite negative development and adds to the already heavy regulatory overhang on the business.\u201d\nOne97 Communications, the parent firm of Paytm, owns a 49% stake in Payment Payments Bank. A payments bank license allows the holder to offer a number of banking services, though some restrictions are in place.\nThe RBI also directed One97 Communications and Paytm Payments Services to terminate their nodal accounts \u201cat the earliest.\u201d Without the nodal account, Paytm will likely have to move many of its businesses to other banks, according to preliminary assessment by industry executives.\n\u201cSettlement of all pipeline transactions and nodal accounts (in respect of all transactions initiated on or before February 29, 2024) shall be completed by March 15, 2024 and no further transactions shall be permitted thereafter,\u201d RBI added.\nCustomers can continue to withdraw and utilize money from their accounts, RBI said. Paytm Payments Bank will also not be allowed to offer credit transactions, including via wallets, RBI said.\nIn 2022, RBI slapped Paytm Payments Bank with penalties after finding that the Noida-headquartered firm had violated rules by allowing data to flow to servers outside of India and didn\u2019t properly verify its customers.\n",

      "title": "Apple Vision Pro: Day One",
      "content": "\nIt\u2019s Friday, February 2,\u00a02024. Today is the day. You\u2019ve been eyeing the Vision Pro since Tim Cook stepped onstage with the product at last year\u2019s WWDC. Longer than that, really, if you factor in the years of rumors, leaks and renderings. The price wasn\u2019t anywhere near what you had hoped, but it\u2019s a first-gen product. Manufacturing isn\u2019t at full consumer scale and you\u2019ve got to factor in the millions poured into seven or eight years of R&D.\nAfter a few months of waffling, you hovered your cursor over the \u201cBuy\u201d button, held your breath, closed your eyes and committed to the tune of $3,500. Congratulations, you\u2019re an early adopter.\nThe box arrives. It\u2019s huge. It\u2019s also quintessentially Apple \u2014 it\u2019s premium, designed with intention. Tear the tabs on other side and slide off the top. The visor is inside, anchored to a small platform that\u2019s more display case than shipping container. Dig deeper, and you\u2019ll find another strap and a second \u201clight seal\u201d insert.\nMe, I\u2019m currently partial to the Dual Loop Band. It doesn\u2019t look as cool as the Solo Knit Band, but the top strap does a much better job distributing weight (the Vision Pro is not a light headset). As for the light seal inserts, I advise glasses-wearers to go with the larger of the pair to create more distance between your eyes and the inserts.\nLast, of course, is the now-infamous battery pack. Plug it into the port on the left side and give it a twist. A small white light pulses before turning solid. The boot-up has begun.\n\n\nApple Vision Pro: Day One. Your $3,500 headset just arrived. Now what?\nRead @bheater's experience with the Vision Pro here: https://t.co/znlYXuecLS pic.twitter.com/745krTqsq4\n\u2014 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) February 1, 2024\n\nAfter eight months, what\u2019s another 60 seconds between friends? There\u2019s a bit of a setup process. Understandably so. The Vision Pro has to orient its sensors, get to know your space and lighting. If you had Zeiss optical inserts made for your vision, now is the time to snap them in, magnetically. If you\u2019re a glasses wearer, don\u2019t freak out about the image too much until you\u2019ve enrolled your lenses by holding up a piece of paper with a QR-like code on it. Pairing the device to your iPhone works in much the same fashion.\nYou\u2019ll be asked to pull the headset off for a bit, to take a scan of your face. But first, a short introductory video.\nThe face scan process utilizes the camera on the front of the visor to construct a shoulders-up 3D avatar. The process is extremely similar to enrolling in Face ID on your iPhone. Look forward. Turn your head to the side. Then the other. Look up and rotate down. Look down and rotate up. Find some good lighting. Maybe a ring light if you have one. If you wear glasses, make a point not to squint. I apparently did, and now my Persona looks like it spent the last week celebrating the passage of Ohio\u2019s Issue 2 ballot measure.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater (Sorry)\nThe Personas that have thus far been made public have been a mixed bag. All of the influencers nailed theirs. Is it the lighting? Good genes? Maybe it\u2019s Maybelline. I hope yours goes well, and don\u2019t worry, you can try again if you didn\u2019t stick the landing the first time. Mine? This is actually the better of the two I\u2019ve set up so far. I still look like a talking thumb with a huffing addiction, and the moment really brings out the lingering Bell\u2019s palsy in my right eye. Or maybe more of a fuzzy Max Headroom? I\u2019ll try again tomorrow, and until then be mindful of the fact that the feature is effectively still in beta.\nThis is the version of you who will be speaking to people through FaceTime and other teleconferencing apps. This is meant to circumvent the fact that 1) You have a visor on your face and 2) There (probably) isn\u2019t an external camera pointed at you. It definitely takes some getting used to.\nOh, you\u2019ll also have to take it again if you want to change your hair or shirt. I was hoping for something a bit more adaptable \u00e0 la Memojis, but that\u2019s not in the current feature set. It will, however, respond to different facial expressions like smiling, raising your eyebrows and even sticking out your tongue (handy for Zoom work calls). The scan is also used to generate an image of your eyes for the EyeSight feature on the front of the visor to alert others in the room when you are looking in their direction.\nPut the headset back on and hold your hands up so the hand-tracking feature knows what to look out for. Next, three circles of dots will appear, each with brighter light than the last. Here you\u2019ll have to look at each while pinching your thumb and index fingers together. This helps calibrate eye tracking.\nInput has long been a big question mark in the world of extended reality. You can pair Bluetooth game controllers, keyboards and trackpads with the headset, but in Apple\u2019s vision of the future, the lion\u2019s share of interaction utilizes your eyes and hands. Look at an object to highlight and pinch your fingers to select. Pinches also come into play when zooming (pinch with both hands before pulling them apart) and scrolling (pinch and swipe).\nThe digital crown is your friend. It\u2019s basically a bigger version of the one on your Apple Watch. Pressing it brings up an apps display, similar to Launchpad on MacOS. The apps sidebar also showcases different Environments and People/Contacts. Long-pressing the crown centers visionOS where you\u2019re looking.\nMy biggest tip to you, the owner of a shiny new Vision Pro, is give yourself time to adjust. This is going to be the last thing you want to hear. Listen, I get it. You spent a car down payment on a device you\u2019ve been waiting more than half a year to try. But coming face to face with a new version of reality can do weird things to your brain if you don\u2019t take breaks. People have reported headaches from the weight. Personally, I\u2019m prone to motion sickness and am feeling a bit off at the end of my first full day with the device.\nWatch an episode of a TV show. Play a quick game (you can play the iPadOS versions of Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds with an Apple Arcade subscription). If this is, indeed, the dawn of a new era for computing, you\u2019ve got plenty of time to acclimate.\nSee you tomorrow.\n",

      "title": "Apple Vision Pro\u2019s secret weapon? Mindfulness",
      "content": "\nMore than anything, Apple\u2019s Vision Pro is a beginning. There are moments while using it that feel like a porthole into a different world and \u2014 just maybe \u2014 the future. It\u2019s imperfect, sure, but it\u2019s an undeniable accomplishment after so many decades of extended reality false starts. Using the headset for even a few minutes is a mesmerizing experience but, perhaps more importantly, offers tangible glimpses into where things are going.\nI\u2019ve long been a sucker for mindfulness apps. That\u2019s not to say that I use them much these days, but it feels like I\u2019ve tried every one. One key thing that engaging with a Headspace or Calm lacks on a phone or tablet is immersion. It\u2019s hard to overstate how powerful a tool immersion is, particularly for those who are just beginning their practice. It\u2019s something the Vision Pro has in spades.\nMuch like the world of AR and VR, my own practice has been littered with false starts. Meditation is hard. Full stop. Even seasoned veterans have difficulty silencing noisy brains. It\u2019s far more difficult when first attempting to get your footing. It can be frustrating and anxiety-inducing, effectively having the opposite of the intended effect; but you have to be patient, committed and willing to put in the time if you\u2019re going to push through.\nAlong with the apps, I\u2019m a sucker for trying out pretty much any piece of hardware that promises to help kickstart a mindfulness practice. They are, as you\u2019ve no doubt surmised, largely crap \u2014 the kind of plastic garbage that gets used twice and then stashed in a drawer until your family gets things for your estate sale. (Here I will carve out a caveat for Muse\u2019s clever meditation band \u2014 that one genuinely helped me along.)\nI\u2019ve always found mindfulness to be one of the most compelling use cases for extended reality. Again, it\u2019s that sense of full immersion that does so much heavy lifting, drowning out life\u2019s distractions. Well, to a point. My jarring NYC apartment buzzer went off right in the middle of this morning\u2019s session. There\u2019s only so much you can do. As for the cluttered apartment, the whine of the radiator, the rabbit rustling and my yell-talking neighbors, pop in a pair of AirPods Pro and you\u2019re off the races.\nApple has offered Mindfulness on the iPhone and Apple Watch for a while now. It\u2019s a basic app, primarily targeted on breathing. It lacks the complexity and content of apps like Calm, but anyone who\u2019s ever successfully meditated will gladly tell you how important breathing is to the process. It\u2019s like the drums in a rock track \u2014 it\u2019s centering and constant.\nImage Credits: Apple\nHere\u2019s Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki from his seminal 1970 book, \u201cZen Mind, Beginner\u2019s Mind\u201d:\nWhen we practice zazen our mind always follows our breathing. When we inhale, the air comes into our inner world. When we exhale, the air goes out to the outer world. The inner world is limitless, and the outer world is also limitless. We say \u201cinner world\u201d or \u201couter world,\u201d but actually there is just one whole world. In this limitless world, our throat is like a swinging door. The air comes in and goes out like someone passing through a swinging door.\nIf you think \u201cI breathe,\u201d the \u201cI\u201d is extra. There is no you to say \u201cI.\u201d What we call \u201cI\u201d is just a swinging door which moves when we inhale and when we exhale. It just moves; that is all. When your mind is pure and calm enough to follow this movement, there is nothing: no \u201cI,\u201d no world, no mind nor body; just a swinging door.\nThe Vision Pro version of Mindfulness operates in much the same manner. An image like a circle of flower petals expands and contracts to help you center your breathing, while a narrator offers a guided meditation. It\u2019s simple, like the best parts of Zen.\nCouple it with the headset\u2019s Environment offers (effectively 3D desktop wallpaper for the world around you) and you\u2019ve got an appropriate level of immersion that forces you to focus on the app, which forces you to focus on your breathing, making you mindful of a powerful and important aspect of our lives that most people take for granted most of the time. Suddenly, you\u2019re meditating on a sandy beach or the moon.\nIt\u2019s the kind of tool I would have loved to have had access to in those early days when I struggled so hard to focus. It\u2019s also a much welcome respite in a device that is half-productivity, half-entertainment.\nApple\u2019s Mindfulness app is hardly the end all, be all for the space. It\u2019s the tip of the iceberg, but a hopeful tip. When such a basic app can have such a powerful effect, it\u2019s exciting to think about the direction devs might go in, both in terms of mindfulness tools and altered states. Sorry, I can\u2019t help sounding like late-period Timothy Leary when I write about this stuff, but I\u2019m very much looking forward to seeing where this goes.\n",

      "title": "Senate hearing with five social media CEOs was a missed opportunity",
      "content": "\nFive social media CEOs were sworn in on Wednesday for what could have been the most eventful children\u2019s online safety hearing yet. But even with some of tech\u2019s most powerful figures under oath, the four-hour hearing was anti-climactic.\nThe Senate subpoenaed recently appointed X CEO Linda Yaccarino, Discord\u2019s Jason Citron and Snap\u2019s Evan Spiegel to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok\u2019s Shou Chew agreed to appear without the threat of legal consequence. Yaccarino, Citron and Spiegel all testified for the first time, while Chew faced the committee last year. But for Zuckerberg, this hearing was his eighth rodeo, and it wasn\u2019t an easy one.\nThese CEOs certainly have a lot to answer for. Chat-based platforms Snap and Discord have come under fire for facilitating sextortion crimes and lethal drug dealing, while Meta has been implicated in a laundry list of high-stakes scandals regarding the mental health of teens on its platforms. Meanwhile, TikTok\u2019s algorithmic feed has been found to surface content related to self-harm and suicide, and X has become a breeding ground for white supremacy and extremism.\nSome senators remarked that at today\u2019s hearing, the chamber was as packed as it\u2019s ever been in their careers.\n\u201cWe have a large audience, the largest I\u2019ve seen in this room today,\u201d stated Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), who has served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for over 20 years.\nZuckerberg in particular drew immense ire, perhaps since Meta has such a long track record of safety failures. Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported on internal Meta documents that showed multiple instances of employees raising concerns about child exploitation on the company\u2019s messaging apps, to no avail; and The Wall Street Journal has published multiple reports about the negative impact of Instagram on teenage girls\u2019 mental health, among other concerning revelations. The Senate floor was packed with the families of children who have been victims of sexual exploitation, mental health issues and drug overdoses via social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram.\nIn the most dramatic moment of the hearing, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) zeroed in on Zuckerberg, asking him to apologize to these families.\n\u201cThere\u2019s families of victims here today. Have you apologized to the victims? Would you like to do so now?\u201d Hawley pressed, reminding Zuckerberg that he was on national television. In a rare moment for a Senate hearing, Zuckerberg stood up, turned around and faced the audience to address them directly, while some parents held up photos of their deceased children in the air.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything you have all been through,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cNo one should go through the things that your families have suffered. This is why we invest so much, and are going to continue doing industry-leading efforts to make sure that no one has to go through the types of things that your families have had to suffer.\u201d\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 JANUARY 31: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, arrives to testify during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on January 31, 2024 in Washington, DC. The committee heard testimony from the heads of the largest tech firms on the dangers of child sexual exploitation on social media. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\nHawley proceeded by asking the CEO directly if he would set up a fund with his own money to pay the families of children who have been severely harmed from abuse they\u2019ve experienced on Meta platforms. Zuckerberg started to tell the senator that these issues are complicated, before he was cut off, and Hawley repeated the question. Both Zuckerberg and Hawley became increasingly agitated.\n\u201cWell, senator, we\u2019re doing an industry-leading effort, we\u2019re building AI tools that \u2013\u201d\n\u201cOh, nonsense. Your product is killing people. Will you personally commit to compensating the victims? You\u2019re a billionaire.\u201d\nZuckerberg did not make that commitment.\nLegislative efforts\nAs multiple senators try to push legislation to regulate children\u2019s online safety, much of the questioning at today\u2019s hearing revolved around whether each CEO would support any given bill.\nOf all these bills, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) seems to have the most momentum. Sponsored by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), the bill would require social platforms to take further steps to protect children online. Though the bill has been revised, critics worry about its potential impact on internet privacy and access to information. For instance, the bill gives individual state attorneys general the right to constitute what internet content is appropriate for kids. Blackburn has already implied that KOSA could be used in this way to prevent children from accessing information about transgender people.\nPrivacy advocates also call into question the potential for KOSA to jeopardize end-to-end encryption, and surveil and censor adults\u2019 experiences online.\n\u201cUltimately, no amendment will change the basic fact that KOSA\u2019s duty of care turns what is meant to be a bill about child safety into a censorship bill that will harm the rights of both adult and minor users,\u201d the Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote in a recent blog post.\nSenator Blumenthal asked all five CEOs if they would support KOSA. Snap\u2019s Evan Spiegel and X\u2019s Linda Yaccarino both voiced their support for the bill, while the CEOs from Meta, Discord and TikTok wavered.\n\u201cThere are parts of the act that we think are great,\u201d said Discord CEO Jason Citron, nodding toward the potential privacy issues. \u201cWe very much think that a national privacy standard would be great.\u201d\nAs Spiegel affirmed Snap\u2019s support, Blumenthal added that Microsoft just announced it would support KOSA as well. But Chew would not pledge his support as the bill stands.\n\u201cWith some changes, we can support it,\u201d Chew said. When pressed further, he elaborated, \u201cWe\u2019re aware some groups have raised some concerns.\u201d Before he could finish his thought, Blumenthal said he would take that answer as a no.\nChew is correct that KOSA has spurred controversy among various activist organizations.\n\u201cDozens of human rights, civil liberties, LGBTQ+ and racial justice groups oppose the reckless legislation being proposed in today\u2019s hearing,\u201d Fight for the Future Director Evan Greer said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cHundreds of parents of transgender kids have specifically urged lawmakers to consider alternatives to KOSA.\u201d\nZuckerberg was able to voice a bit more about these concerns before he was cut off.\n\u201cThese are nuanced things. I think that the basic spirit is right, and the basic ideas in it are right, and there are some ideas that I would debate how to best \u2013\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think we can count on social media as a group or Big Tech to support this measure,\u201d Blumenthal said.\nWasted time\nIt\u2019s an immense opportunity to have five social media leaders sitting before you, legally obligated to answer your questions in truth. But, as happens in many Senate hearings, some senators used their time to advance their own political agendas, or to naively bully panelists.\nWhen TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before Congress last year, he was prodded on TikTok\u2019s relationship to its Chinese parent company ByteDance, and by extension, its connection (or lack-thereof) with the Chinese Community Party (CCP). While some reports have shown evidence of Chinese ByteDance employees accessing American TikTok data, there is no known evidence of that data being obtained by the CCP.\nChew spoke about these issues last year in a five-hour hearing in front of many of these same senators. But they chose to continue questioning Chew about his own personal political allegiances.\nSenator Tom Cotton (R-AK) was particularly confrontational in his approach.\n\u201cHave you ever been a member of the Chinese Community Party?\u201d asked Cotton.\n\u201cNo, senator, I\u2019m Singaporean,\u201d replied Chew.\n\u201cHave you ever been associated or affiliated with the Chinese Community Party?\u201d Cotton asked.\n\u201cNo, senator, I\u2019m Singaporean,\u201d Chew repeated.\nCotton\u2019s questions to Chew revolved more around his personal history than his role as CEO of a social media platform with over a billion users. Cotton acknowledged Chew lives in Singapore, but asked of what nation he is a citizen (Singapore). He also asked what nations Chew possesses a passport from (Singapore). When Cotton asked if Chew had ever applied for Chinese citizenship, he reminded the senator that he served for two and a half years in the Singaporean military. While working at ByteDance, Chew lived in Beijing for five years, but he also lived in the United States while attending Harvard Business School, where he met his wife, who is American.\nCotton, as well as Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), went as far as to ask Chew about what happened in Tiananmen Square, a topic that the Chinese government forbids its citizens from discussing.\n\u201cYou said earlier in response to your question [from Cruz] that what happened at Tiananmen Square in June of 1989 was a massive protest. Anything else happened in Tiananmen Square?\u201d Cotton asked.\n\u201cYes, I think it\u2019s well-documented,\u201d Chew replied. \u201cThere was a massacre.\u201d\nThese pointed lines of questioning ate up significant chunks of time in a hearing that had the potential to yield helpful discussion about online safety. Instead, the hearing was a blown opportunity.\nBy the end of the hearing, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) summed up the situation quite well.\n\u201cEvery year, we have an annual flogging. And what materially has occurred over the last nine years?\u201d\n\nMicrosoft, X throw their weight behind KOSA, the controversial kids online safety bill\n\n\nMark Zuckerberg defends teenage creators\u2019 right to public Instagram accounts\n\n",

      "content": "\nYou don\u2019t need to resort to the dark web to find your illicit pill counterfeiting presses and molds. Just go to eBay and you can get one like new for a great price! Or at least you could until recently, when the Justice Department sued the company for facilitating the sale of thousands of devices clearly intended for illegal purposes \u2014 and now eBay owes $59 million.\nPill presses are the things you use if you\u2019re a drug manufacturer \u2014 or a counterfeiter \u2014 to turn raw materials into pill form. While there are no doubt some perfectly mundane home uses for the smaller varieties of these things, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone needing to make thousands of pills per hour unless they\u2019re a drug runner.\nNot only were pill presses being sold on eBay, but the same buyers were also picking up counterfeit molds, stamps, and dyes, which let them produce fake pills of specific medications. The DOJ news release notes that many of these buyers were subsequently prosecuted; I\u2019ve asked for more information on that, since it sounds like eBay may have unwittingly acted as a huge honey pot.\nAnyone can tell you the opioid epidemic in the U.S. is real, and easy access to pill-counterfeiting hardware can only make it worse. Scoring a bag of Oxy off the street after getting addicted to the real thing, and getting something laced with fentanyl instead \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of mistake that can, and does, cost lives with disturbing regularity.\neBay contended in a statement that it had taken \u201cactions\u201d to remove these devices \u201cprior to any request from the DOJ or other authorities, and years before the government turned its attention to these products.\u201d It\u2019s hard to square this with the settlement, which states that the relevant time period was late 2015 to the present, during which time eBay did not properly record or report sales of the machines, despite selling thousands of commercial-grade presses to residential addresses \u2014 and sold counterfeit stamps and such to the same buyers. I\u2019ve asked eBay for clarification on this.\nWhatever eBay\u2019s \u201cactions\u201d were, they amounted to less than the authorities would prefer, and to avoid any admission of wrongdoing (as is tradition) they have agreed to pay $59 million and \u201cenhance its compliance program with respect to its prohibited and restricted items policy.\u201d\nIn case you hear a bell ringing somewhere in your mind, this is a different case from that brought in September over the sale of illegal and dangerous pollutants.\n\nDOJ says eBay sold thousands of illegal, poisonous and polluting products\n\n",

      "title": "Spice up your desktop with these unusual keyboards from Keychron, HHKB, Cloud Nine and others",
      "content": "\nMechanical keyboards are everywhere these days, and there\u2019s a larger variety now than ever before. If you\u2019re looking to pick one up but want to look beyond the most common layouts and types, read on. Here are eight mechanical keyboards that stick out from the pack.\nFeker Alice 80\nImage Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch\nMy first Alice board! And to my great joy, the Feker Alice 80 is a solid \u2014 very solid \u2014 example of this layout, though its foibles should not be overlooked. The Alice 80 is of a similar build type to Keychron\u2019s Q series, with a full-contact bottom (plus traditional flip-out feet) and all keys mounted on a gasket. In addition, Feker added \u201ca sound dampening silicon switch pad, a silicone PCB foam and a bottom cotton foam\u201d to further silence the Gateron Yellow switches.\nI can tell you it makes quite a difference, and anyone would agree in a few keystrokes. The quiet, medium actuation linear switches feel like they\u2019re being pushed through a cloud, and are as close to silent as any mechanical keyboard I\u2019ve used. That is to say, very quiet but for a sort of soft, rippling sound when you\u2019re really going. It\u2019s really very comfortable and my daily driver for now.\nThis board has a slightly unusual layout, with a windows key to the right of the left space bar segment. I thought I\u2019d hit it by accident a lot, but I didn\u2019t once. It also has a light curve to the angled keys rather than a sudden turn, and a subtle but comfortable tenting angle. On the right edge, you\u2019ve got arrows and page up and down, plus delete. Add a volume dial and that\u2019s it! It\u2019s not as minimal as some, but it\u2019s pretty minimal. If I could have, I would have gotten the 75% version with the function row and aluminum build, but there are none left \u2014 for good reason, no doubt. This version is a little flexy and not perfectly balanced, though only at the corners.\nBut what may put some people off it is the relative lack of customization. The board doesn\u2019t come with any extra keys for swapping out (if you have a Mac layout, say) and although there is a software configurator, I was unable to get it to do more than swap one key with another or macro. So I couldn\u2019t, for instance, set \u201cPlay/Pause\u201d to function+down.\nI\u2019ll tell you this \u2014 if I was sitting down to do a marathon writing session, this is one of the first boards I\u2019d reach for. But if I needed regular access to function and other keys or any kind of more complicated layering (as many keyboard enthusiasts like), then I wouldn\u2019t be able to use it. The feel isn\u2019t quite right for gaming either, in my opinion, but I didn\u2019t let that stop me. That it works wired, on Bluetooth or using a Wi-Fi dongle is just icing on the cake.\nFeker Alice 98\nImage Credits: Feker\nHere\u2019s a keyboard with a lot of potential but that ultimately didn\u2019t charm me. The Alice layout plus a number pad on the right, a knob and a tiny LCD screen. Seems like a great match for anyone who wants the ergo benefits of Alice but needs those numbers and doesn\u2019t mind losing a little desktop space.\nBut the Alice 98 is offered with only Kailh Winter switches, which despite the gasket underneath are just not my style \u2014 maybe they just need oiling, but they felt like they had a lot more friction, and not just an intentionally higher resistance. They\u2019re not bad by any means, but the Yellows on the 80 just are a perfect match.\nThe layout also has a less pronounced tent, almost none at all in fact, which with the tilted key layout actually makes it seem like you\u2019re twisting your wrists inward a bit. I didn\u2019t expect that, but now I understand why the tenting built into the 80 makes it seem flat when it isn\u2019t.\nAnd lastly, the software support just isn\u2019t there for a keyboard of this complexity. The firmware offered on the site didn\u2019t even register as a real file on my computer, and set off some virus-esque alarm bells. And if I\u2019m going to have an LCD on at all times, I\u2019d like to be able to program it properly. So until the 98 gets the support it needs (and maybe some different switches), I can\u2019t really recommend it.\nKeychron Q11\nImage Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch\nKeychron has become one of the most popular mechanical keyboard vendors, putting out solid boards with lots of customization options in an increasingly wide range of layouts. This 75% split Q11 is among the latest, and could be a fantastic option for those who don\u2019t need tilting or tenting.\nThe Q11 is minimal and pleasingly industrial-looking, with a totally flat, very solid build. It sits directly on your desk with small rubberized feet, making it low profile and pretty much as compact as is physically possible with a 75% layout. The halves also fit together cleanly to form a more standard layout. It\u2019s a wired-only board, and you\u2019ll have to connect the two halves with a bridge cable, so if that kind of desk clutter offends you, move on. But for those who don\u2019t mind a little visible cabling, it\u2019s a handsome and understated look.\nThe version I tested has Gateron Brown switches, which make for a nice light typing feel, albeit somewhat harder on the fingers due to the lack of a gasket or dampening layer. After typing on the Feker Alice this was definitely a more raw feel, but it\u2019s still comfortable and quiet \u2014 just be wary of bottoming out (and consider selecting a higher resistance switch).\nThe layout is compact and has plenty of layers plus five dedicated macro keys to the left, and interestingly two knobs, one in each upper corner. Normally the knob is relegated to volume duty and perhaps something else on another layer, but this lets you try out some interesting new use cases, like scrolling the page or moving the cursor. This is a nice, very portable split option if you\u2019re willing to give up a little of that typefeel.\nKeychron Q13 Pro\nImage Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch\nWell, there\u2019s no getting around it: This keyboard is a bludgeoning weapon disguised as a computer peripheral. Weighing in at 2.4 kilograms (5.2 pounds) and with a solid aluminum body, this is definitely the keyboard I\u2019d reach for if I was being charged by a zombie. You could hammer nails with this thing, no joke. But how does it perform?\nWith a 75% Alice layout, the Q13 is unusually but practically laid out. The main cluster is traditional Alice (down to two \u201cB\u201d keys), with macro and function keys scattered around the edge in staggered rows. It\u2019s not actually that large, but combined with the weight and increased height it feels more spread out, bulky even.\nThe keycaps have an extra scoop to them in the Keychron style, which is a mixed bag. In the center and upper rows it feels like they are reaching out to greet your extended finger, minimizing movement. But in the lower rows it feels like there\u2019s a ridge sticking up above where it shouldn\u2019t be. The space bar\u2019s shape, for instance, gives it a sharp angle where my thumb makes contact, which is not something I enjoyed, and somehow the act of reaching for the backspace key puts the middle of my right hand in contact with the up-thrusting left arrow key.\nToo much scoop. Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch\nThese aren\u2019t dealbreakers (well, the space bar was for me) but they might require a bit of getting used to, or a bit of key swapping.\nIt connects via Bluetooth or cable, and can sync with three different devices at once and switch quickly between them \u2014 always useful.\nCloud Nine ErgoTKL\nImage Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch\nA full-featured split ergo keyboard, the Cloud Nine ErgoTKL packs a lot of options into a relatively compact package. It has a compact tenkeyless layout but with a full (if unseparated) function row, which I appreciate, as well as arrows and navigation, plus a couple swappable macro keys on the left. And of course there\u2019s that great big wheel in the middle.\nThe ErgoTKL has the split angle to its key layout, plus a light built-in tenting angle that I found quite comfortable, though being able to adjust it would have been a plus. The two halves are easily separated but also come together nicely with a magnet to form a whole, with the wheel dead center.\nThe switches, Kailh Browns on my unit, were light and snappy, with an audible but not bothersome click \u2014 you can pick linear Reds or clicky Whites as well. I could ask for a bigger space key \u2014 it seems like not all the ergo keyboard makers account for the different position your thumb takes when at this angle. Or maybe it\u2019s just me, but I end up on the corner of the space key when it\u2019s canted this way.\nIt is of course full RGB, something I\u2019ve never had any use for, and almost all the pre-loaded modes are gaudy, shifting rainbows. Fortunately there\u2019s a very easy to use configurator that I put together a nice, chill custom color layout in within minutes.\nThe central wheel is a nice tactile one, which you can set to a variety of functions (though sadly not cursor movement). It kind of looks like it would get in the way, but that never once happened for me. I only wish I could assign it to have one function normally, and another while activating the Fn layer.\nI had some slight issues with mine, one with a random repeating disconnection that seems to have fixed itself, and another in that the left half of the keyboard doesn\u2019t sit flat on its little rubber pads. With the weight of my hand on it, it\u2019s plenty stable, but it\u2019s troubling in a serious keyboard to see it wobbling back and forth. The plastic palm rests are also not great \u2014 I\u2019d spring for the padded ones.\n8Bitdo Retro Mechanical Keyboard\n8BitDo\u2019s NES-themed mechanical keyboard. Image Credits:\u00a08BitDo\nOkay, this one isn\u2019t really ergonomic, but it is unusual. This wired/wireless (dongle or Bluetooth) mechanical is fully custom from the switches up, and obviously it falls under 8BitDo\u2019s retro aesthetic to the point where you might think it\u2019s an official Nintendo accessory. (It\u2019s not.)\nIt\u2019s a very clicky keyboard, but comfortable as flat layouts go, and compact enough that you can easily add your own wrist rests. There are two built in dials, one for wireless mode select and one for volume. But the real innovation is the giant macro buttons marked A and B like huge NES controllers.\nLook, I\u2019m aware there are other standalone macro clusters out there. You can buy one for 10 or 20 bucks online. But these huge, cherry red mega-buttons are something else. I\u2019ll say right now that they\u2019re not quite as satisfying to press as they look, but they feel durable enough that you can really whack them if you\u2019ve assigned them to stuff like close application or end call.\nHHKB Studio\nImage Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch\nHere\u2019s an odd one and no mistake. The HHKB Studio is one of a kind, with a unique layout, a pointer nub, mouse buttons built in and four \u2014 count \u2019em \u2014 four touch-sensitive strips all around it. The idea behind it is to remove the necessity of a mouse at all, letting you never move your hands from the keyboard.\nAnd although it would take some getting used to, I think the hardware (handsome, understated and well-built) truly supports this proposition. But there are a handful of major quirks you\u2019ll have to get past.\nFirst, and most unhinged, is that there is NO BACKSPACE KEY. At least by default. You need to adjust a dipswitch to change delete to backspace, or you can do it in the customization software. Then, as you may know if you\u2019re familiar with the Happy Hacking layout, caps lock is replaced by control, and delete/backspace and the forward slash have switched places. Though these changes are made with good intent, I simply can\u2019t abide some of them, though fortunately it was easily configured. Lastly, the choice to use AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one is just plain strange to me!\nThe space between the little upraised bits is touch-sensitive. Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch\nThe trackpoint is good, and adequate for desktop tasks, and the presence of mouse buttons just under the space bar is quite nice once you get used to it. It\u2019s a bit odd hitting left-click with my left hand while moving the cursor with my right, but it does save me a trip to the mouse.\nThe capacitive strips are the most interesting piece, though, and I think they\u2019re a qualified success. They run along the edges of the board, two on the front and one on each side. The left ones are set to basically repeat arrow keys (nice because they\u2019re not present on this very compact layout), and the right ones are scroll up/down and switch apps by default.\nThis could be a real time saver, but you need to get good at it, because there\u2019s no tactile feedback and the strips themselves can be a little hard to find sometimes. And then, when they\u2019re activated, they can be a little unpredictable. While I appreciate the effort that went into packing this much capability into this much space \u2014 and it really is a lot of power in a remarkably small form factor \u2014 I feel like the purpose would be better served with the strips facing upwards, or maybe even being along the corner (if that\u2019s possible).\nIf you\u2019re a really keyboard-centric person and want to be even more so, or want a good couch keyboard option, the HHKB Studio could be a real eye-opener.\nKinesis Advantage 360 (Quiet Limited)\nImage Credits: Kinesis\nIf you\u2019re ready for an ergo adventure, here\u2019s one that\u2019s challenging yet logical. The Advantage360 is Kinesis\u2019s high-end model with not just a columnar layout but a concave contour to minimize finger movements. And then your position and modifier keys are all in thumb clusters. The one I tested was a limited edition with Kailh Box Pink Linear Quiet switches and special colorway.\nLook, any one of these things I could probably adapt quickly to. Two would take time. All three at once is madness! That said, it\u2019s really obvious that this could be an extremely comfortable and worthwhile layout for someone willing to put in the time, like the Moonlander I tried in the last roundup. Or if you\u2019re already in this wild world of layouts \u2014 this is a nice one.\nThe Advantage360 also has a sturdy tenting paddle setup that let me get a pretty sharp angle going. Overall the build quality was outstanding.\nOn the days I was using it, I would alternate between being unable to locate C and suddenly and effortlessly typing a word with what felt like no movement at all. This is definitely a specialist keyboard, and the price ($449) reflects that, but if you\u2019re already rocking a columnar or concave layout you may adapt to this one in a jiffy. Well, maybe not a jiffy.\n",

      "title": "Apple Vision Pro: How to preorder and test the $3,500 headset",
      "content": "\nThe much-hyped Apple Vision Pro headset is almost here for those who have preordered, or those waiting to give it an in-person demo. Billed as the future of spatial computing, the AR/VR headset might not be for everyone based on its hefty $3,499 price tag and lack of apps like Netflix and YouTube at launch (though it will come with Disney+, Max and 150 3D movies, immersive films and series). Estimates show that the company might have sold between 160,000 and 180,000 headsets over the course of the weekend when preorders began. Though that amount is far lower than the typical rollout of the newest iPhone, there will be a wave of early adopters willing to don the headset when it launches Friday.\nOur first impressions of the Apple Vision Pro, as well as our more recent hands-on experience with it, have resulted in impressive results, though it\u2019s still unclear who the headset is ultimately for and what it could become as a device in regular use. We\u2019ll have more extensive thoughts for you when we get to spend more time with the device.\nAs the launch day gets closer, here\u2019s everything you need to know about how to preorder an Apple Vision Pro for yourself.\n\nHow to preorder the Apple Vision Pro\nPreorders for the Apple Vision Pro are now live on Apple\u2019s website. From there, you will use Face ID on your iPhone or iPad to measure yourself for the right fit for the Light Seal and headbands. It will also prompt you to select whether or not you need optical inserts, with readers and prescription options listed at $99 and $149, respectively. Because you cannot use the Apple Vision Pro while wearing glasses, you will have to provide a \u201clegible comprehensive prescription\u201d with your distance correction and near correction needs, the expiration date, your name, date of birth and your prescriber\u2019s license number and signature. The reader inserts come in +0.75 to +1.25D, +1.50 to +1.75D and +2.00 to +2.75D.\nThen it\u2019s time to choose how much storage space you\u2019ll need. The base device starts at 256GB for $3,499, then it\u2019s $3,699 for 512GB and $3,899 for 1TB.\nFinally, you\u2019ll decide how you want to pay for the device, either by buying it outright or in installments starting at $291.58 per month with an Apple Card and whether or not you want to add AppleCare+ coverage to your device for $499, or $24.99 per month. Once you\u2019re through, you can choose to pick up the device at an Apple Store or have it delivered to your home for free.\nIn addition to the Apple Vision Pro headset itself, the preorder will include a dual-loop adjustable band, a protective cover, a cleaning cloth, an external battery and a 30W USB-C adapter and USB\u2011C charging cable.\nHow to try the Apple Vision Pro in-store\nIf you\u2019re unsure about committing to the pricey Vision Pro just based on reviews and images, Apple is offering 25-minute demos in select stores for those who want to try it out for themselves. Sign-ups for the demos begin at 8:00 a.m. at participating Apple retail locations\u2019 local times on February 2, and will be available on \u201ca first-come, first-served basis.\u201d Though Apple says the in-person demos go through the weekend, it\u2019s possible they will be available longer.\nGiven the hype leading up to the Vision Pro\u2019s launch, it\u2019s likely delivery windows could be longer than expected for more recent preorders, so make sure to check the estimated arrival or pickup times when checking out.\u00a0\n\n",

      "content": "\nReliance-backed Viacom18 has reached an agreement to buy 60% of Disney\u2019s India unit, WSJ reported Thursday citing unnamed sources, creating a pathway for the Indian conglomerate to form a $10 billion media giant in the South Asian market.\nThe deal, which WSJ says will close this month, values Disney\u2019s India unit at $3.9 billion, the report said, less than half of what Disney had originally hoped. Earlier this week, Reliance declined to comment on its engagement with Disney.\nViacom18 is a joint venture among Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries, Paramount Global and James Murdoch\u2019s Bodhi Tree Systems. According to the agreement, Disney will retain 40% ownership in its India unit, whereas Reliance will acquire a 51% stake and Bodhi Tree will hold 9%, the report said.\nIn 2019, Disney acquired 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets for $71.3 billion, a move significantly bolstered by the inclusion of Star India.\nThe deal was integral to Disney\u2019s global streaming expansion, handing it broadcast and streaming rights to the Indian Premier League cricket matches, a multitude of multilingual TV channels and an interest in a Bollywood film production company. At the time of acquisition, Star\u2019s Hotstar had amassed about 150 million monthly active users.\nWhile Hotstar dominated the Indian video streaming landscape for several more quarters,\u00a0things have tapered off since as Reliance-backed Viacom18 has grown in popularity after securing the five-year rights to stream IPL cricket matches\u00a0for about $3 billion. Disney paid $3 billion for the same five-year rights, but for broadcasting the content on TV.\nReliance has poached many top leaders and engineering talent to ramp up JioCinema in the last year, and has populated the on-demand streaming service with premium content from HBO and NBC.\nThe merger with Viacom18 reunites Rupert Murdoch\u2019s son James and former Star India CEO Uday Shankar with a business they spent years building. Murdoch helped grow Star India when he was chairman of its former parent Sky, then part of Fox. Shankar led Star India for a decade until 2020.\nShankar and Murdoch, who previously launched a fund called Lupa, formed Bodhi Tree in 2021 with a $1.7 billion backing from\u00a0Qatar Investment Authority.

      "content": "\nThey say don\u2019t shoot the messenger, but what if The Messenger shoots itself?\nMedia startup The Messenger burst on the scene last May with $50 million in hand, aggressively hiring journalists to build an \u201cunbiased\u201d digital newsroom. Instead, its staff found out through a New York Times article today that the publication is shutting down. According to employees\u2019 social media posts, the laid off workers will not receive any severance, and their healthcare coverage will end.\n\u201cThe last thing I saw in The Messenger\u2019s slack was a panicked colleague writing \u2018wait, what about our insurance coverage, I have a surgery boo\u2014\u2019 and then we all got booted out!!!\u201d said journalist Jordan Hoffman in a post on X.\n\n\nThe last thing I saw in The Messenger's slack was a panicked colleague writing \"wait, what about our insurance coverage, I have a surgery boo\u2014\" and then we all got booted out!!!\n\u2014 Jordan Hoffman (@jhoffman) January 31, 2024\n\nThe journalism industry hasn\u2019t had a great year, in part due to declining digital ad sales across the board. But The Messenger\u2019s implosion is shockingly egregious, even in a time when 3,000 journalists have been laid off in the last year.\nFounded by Jimmy Finkelstein (the former owner of The Hollywood Reporter and The Hill), The Messenger had lost about $38 million of its startup capital and only generated $3 million by late last year, per The New York Times. At launch, Finkelstein claimed the company would grow to make $100 million in revenue after its first year, but it only lasted about nine months.\nThe Messenger had been trying to raise additional capital in the hours leading up to its demise. But it failed to secure the funding it needed, which raises the question of why the publication needed to raise more money so soon, anyway.\n\n\nThis is lower than low. To go on a hiring spree, wildly mismanage millions of dollars and then leave hundreds of people with no way to support themselves after working them to the bone is despicable. If any The Messenger reporters are starting a layoff fund please share! https://t.co/cN1YB100UN\n\u2014 Tonya Riley (@TonyaJoRiley) January 31, 2024\n\n\u201cOver the last few weeks, literally until last night, we exhausted every option available and have endeavored to raise sufficient capital to reach profitability,\u201d Finkelstein wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, we have been unable to do so, which is why we haven\u2019t shared the news with you until now. This is truly the last thing I wanted, and I am deeply sorry.\u201d\nLike pretty much every other company that has conducted layoffs in the last few years, Finkelstein cited vague \u201ceconomic headwinds\u201d in his note to staff about the closure (which, we cannot emphasize enough, came\u00a0after\u00a0staff learned that they lost their jobs from a New York Times article). Still, Finkelstein has not addressed just how it\u2019s possible to burn through so much money so quickly.\nFrom the get-go, media experts were skeptical of The Messenger\u2019s game plan, which was to leverage social media referral traffic to generate ad revenue. This strategy for a media business might have worked 15 years ago, but this isn\u2019t the era of the BuzzFeed boom (just look at that company\u2019s stock price). At launch, Nieman Lab noted that The Messenger was publishing a new story every two minutes, some of which were only one sentence long. Though Finkelstein\u2019s ambitions to build a large-scale, unbiased media machine were lofty, they were ultimately doomed to fail. Sadly, that failure means financial uncertainty and precarious healthcare coverage for its workers.\n\u201cI cannot fathom doing this to anyone,\u201d wrote former Messenger staffer Madeline Fitzgerald on X. \u201cI don\u2019t [know] why you would treat employees like this.\u201d\n",

      "content": "\nOn the eve of Wednesday\u2019s Big Tech hearing (both Big Tech and a big hearing \u2014 five CEOs are testifying as we speak), Microsoft stepped up to back a controversial bill that aims to protect children from the dangers of social media. In the early hours of the hearing, X CEO Linda Yaccarino also climbed aboard.\n\u201cSenator, we support KOSA and we\u2019ll continue to make sure that it accelerates and make sure to continue to offer community for teens that are seeking that voice,\u201d Yaccarino said when asked if X, formerly Twitter, will support the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA). The question came when KOSA co-sponsor Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) went down the line of tech CEOs asking if each company would back his legislation.\nThe answer was strangely worded given that KOSA is not yet law, but Yaccarino didn\u2019t offer any of the qualifiers of her more reluctant peers. In a statement to TechCrunch, X confirmed the company\u2019s backing for the bill. \u201cWe support the Kids Online Safety Act and will work to preserve freedom of speech for all groups,\u201d X spokesperson Joe Benarroch said.\nSnap\u2019s Evan Spiegel restated his company\u2019s previous commitment to supporting the new proposal to regulate social media apps. \u201cSenator, we strongly support the Kids Online Safety Act and we\u2019ve already implemented many of its core provisions,\u201d Spiegel said.\nMeta, Discord and TikTok all demurred, pointing to groups that have criticized the bill or stating that they support some of its parts and not others. \u201cSenator, with some changes we can support it,\u201d TikTok CEO Shou Chew said. \u201cWe are aware that some groups have raised some concerns.\u201d\nMark Zuckerberg similarly agreed with the \u201cbasic spirit\u201d of the bill while declining to endorse it. Discord\u2019s Jason Citron said his company supported \u201cparts\u201d of the proposal but declined to say yes, stating that Discord would prefer to support a national privacy standard.\nIn spite of some revisions, the bill\u2019s many critics have warned that KOSA would dangerously sanitize the internet, empower censorship and isolate young LGBTQ people in the process. Security, privacy and free press advocates have also called attention to the bill\u2019s potential threat to encryption. The bill was revised last year in response to some criticisms, but many concerns persist.\nWhile X and Snap are popular social apps, they\u2019re on the fringe compared to the heft of a company like Microsoft. Microsoft, now worth roughly $3 trillion, is currently the most valuable company in the world and a sophisticated operator in the world of policy that\u2019s been around long enough to know how to play the game.\nWhile X and Snap are likely hoping that their KOSA support will either generally endear them to regulators or have a much worse impact on rival companies, Microsoft probably has its sights set on a different issue entirely. Unlike its peers testifying on Capitol Hill, Microsoft doesn\u2019t own a traditional social media network steered by algorithms (Discord is also a notable exception here). For Microsoft, AI is the name of the game \u2014 and throwing support behind a bill that will change the rules for social media companies might buy it some regulatory goodwill where it counts.\n\nFan fiction writers rally fandoms against KOSA, the bill purporting to protect kids online\n\n",

The most obvious one is that the email addresses and usernames bear no resemblance to the corresponding people names,\u201d Hunt wrote on X (previously Twitter.)\nHunt also added that many of the alleged home addresses are fake and \u201cjust don\u2019t exist.\u201d\nThe forum user did not respond when asked to explain Hunt\u2019s observations.\nAt the same time, Hunt is also skeptical that the data was created with ChatGPT.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had fabricated breaches since forever because people want airtime or to make a name for themselves or maybe a quick buck. Who knows, it doesn\u2019t matter, because none of that makes it \u2018AI,\u2019\u201d Hunt wrote.\nEuropcar\u2019s Vevaud did not immediately respond to questions on how the company determined the data was generated with ChatGPT.\nWhen TechCrunch asked ChatGPT to create \u201ca dataset of fake stolen personal data,\u201d the chat bot responded that it could not assist \u201cin creating or promoting any illegal or unethical activities.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s nearly impossible to confidently establish that the fake data was created with ChatGPT or a similar text-generating AI platform, it is feasible that one day hackers will use these tools to create large datasets of fake data.\n",

Wray\u2019s and Easterly\u2019s comments align with findings from Microsoft, which last year said that Volt Typhoon is pursuing the ability to disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the U.S. and Asia region during future crises.\nChina has long denied hacking allegations from the West, describing them as a \u201ccollective disinformation campaign.\u201d\nDuring the hearing, Wray announced that the FBI and the Justice Department carried out an operation in December to disrupt Volt Typhoon\u2019s infrastructure.\nThe operation, first reported by Reuters on Tuesday, saw U.S. authorities disrupt a China-controlled botnet comprising hundreds of U.S.-based routers for small businesses and home offices. These compromised devices \u2014 mostly end-of-life Cisco and Netgear routers that no longer received routine security updates \u2014 had been infected with the \u201cKV Botnet\u201d malware that was designed to stay hidden.\nThe FBI was able to remove the malware from the hijacked routers and sever their connection to the Chinese state-sponsored hackers, the Justice Department confirmed in a statement.\n\u201cThe United States will continue to dismantle malicious cyber operations \u2014 including those sponsored by foreign governments \u2014 that undermine the security of the American people,\u201d commented U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on the announcement.\nIn an advisory published Wednesday, CISA urged device manufacturers to improve their device security by eliminating vulnerabilities in router web interfaces during software development.\nEarlier this month, the FBI and CISA also warned that Chinese-manufactured drones pose a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to critical infrastructure and U.S. national security.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s president-elect faces growing challenges with its chip industry\n\n",

      "content": "\nIvanti warned on Wednesday that hackers are exploiting another previously undisclosed zero-day vulnerability affecting its widely used corporate VPN appliance.\nSince early December, \u200b\u200bChinese state-backed hackers have been exploiting Ivanti Connect Secure\u2019s flaws \u2014 tracked as CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 \u2014 to break into customer networks and steal information.\nIvanti is now warning that it has discovered two additional flaws \u2014 tracked as CVE-2024-21888 and CVE-2024-21893 \u2014 affecting its Connect Secure VPN product. The former is described as a privilege escalation vulnerability, while the latter \u2014 known as a zero-day because Ivanti had no time to fix the bug before hackers began exploiting it \u2014 is a server-side bug that allows an attacker access to certain restricted resources without authentication.\nIn its updated disclosure, Ivanti said it has observed \u201ctargeted\u201d exploitation of the server-side bug. Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security, known as the BSI, said in a translated advisory on Wednesday that it has knowledge of \u201cmultiple compromised systems.\u201d\nThe BSI added that the newly discovered vulnerabilities, particularly the server-side bug, \u201cput all previously mitigated systems at risk again.\u201d Ivanti confirmed it expects \u201ca sharp increase in exploitation\u201d once specifics of the vulnerability are made public.\nIvanti has not attributed these intrusions to a particular threat group. Cybersecurity companies Volexity and Mandiant previously attributed the exploitation of the initial round of Connect Secure bugs to a China government-backed hacking group motivated by espionage. Volexity also said it had observed additional hacking groups actively exploiting the bugs.\nIvanti updated its count of affected customers to \u201cless than 20.\u201d When reached by TechCrunch on Wednesday, Kareena Garg, an agency spokesperson representing Ivanti, would not say how many customers are affected by the new vulnerabilities.\nHowever, Volexity said earlier this month that at least 1,700 Ivanti Connect Secure appliances worldwide had been exploited by the first round of flaws, affecting organizations in the aerospace, banking, defense, government and telecommunications industries, though the number was likely to be far higher.\nThis is particularly true in light of a CISA advisory released on Tuesday, which warned that attackers had bypassed workarounds for current mitigations and detection methods.\nIvanti\u2019s disclosure of the new zero-day comes on the same day that the company released a patch to protect against the previously disclosed \u2014 and subsequently widely exploited \u2014 Connect Secure vulnerabilities, albeit a week later than the company had originally planned. Ivanti spokesperson Garg told TechCrunch that the patches also protect against the two new vulnerabilities disclosed on Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the patch is available to all Ivanti Connect Secure users, as the company previously said that it planned to release the patch on a \u201cstaggered\u201d basis starting January 22. Ivanti is now advising that customers \u201cfactory reset their appliance before applying the patch to prevent the threat actor from gaining upgrade persistence in your environment.\u201d\n\nState-backed hackers are exploiting new Ivanti VPN zero-days \u2014 but no patches yet\n\n",

      "content": "\nSocial media apps can rise quickly and burn out just as fast, but taking a step back and looking at those trends on a longer timeline offers a better glimpse at the big picture.\nThe Pew Research Center\u2019s latest report on Americans\u2019 social media habits is out, rounding up social media usage trends among U.S. users over the last two years. While there may be a few small tweaks with each survey, Pew mostly asks the same questions every couple of years, making it possible to track meaningful changes over time.\nThis year\u2019s report surveyed 5,733 U.S. adults, capturing the data from May to September 2023. Most of the findings are intuitive, showing the slow migrations between social platforms, but there are a few interesting moments in the survey worth highlighting.\n\u201cI think one of the really interesting things that we saw this year is the amount of stability that we saw on many of the platforms that we\u2019re studying,\u201d Pew Research Center Associate Director of Research Jeff Gottfried told TechCrunch.\nWhile many social media stalwarts mostly hovered near their previous numbers from 2021 \u2014 including X, formerly Twitter, surprisingly \u2014 TikTok saw relatively explosive growth over the two-year time frame. In 2021, 21% of adults said they \u201cever use\u201d TikTok, but by last year that proportion was up to 33%. TikTok\u2019s growth among U.S. users didn\u2019t appear to stop Instagram from picking up more adoption as well, and the Meta-owned app went from 40% to 47% in the same time frame.\nImage Credits: Pew Research Center\n\u201cSomething that we really do see especially with TikTok and a couple of the other sites is just how prominent it is among certain [groups] in the population,\u201d Gottfried said.\nTwo platforms that didn\u2019t see much change over the last two years were YouTube and Facebook \u2014 the two most dominant social apps captured by Pew\u2019s survey data. In 2023, 83% of respondents reported ever using YouTube, while 68% said they use Facebook. The latter number is robust considering popular perception that Facebook\u2019s star is falling, but within the constraints of this particular study that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case.\n\u201cA majority of all age groups are using those two platforms, something that really stood out in our data as well,\u201d Gottfried said.\nThe data revealed some intuitive but still noteworthy age gaps for social app usage. While only 15% of people 65 and older use Instagram, that number is 78% for 18 to 29-year-olds. Snap and TikTok showed similar age divides, though a notable 10% of adults 65 and up reported using TikTok. In the survey, 40% of women overall said they use the platform compared to 25% of men.\nPew also collected some demographic information on race, allowing the survey to get a bit more granular on how different communities engage with social apps. A few differences emerged, including that nearly 60% of Hispanic and Asian adults said they use Instagram compared to only 46% of Black adults and 43% of white adults. Hispanic adults had the highest rates of TikTok usage (49%) compared to Black adults (39%), Asian (29%) and white adults (28%).\nPew\u2019s numbers are interesting, but its straightforward approach doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of insight for why these numbers are what they are. The race and gender differences in particular would lend themselves to deeper research.\nWhile the 2021 Pew survey measured Nextdoor usage along with a slate of more traditional social media apps, the 2023 version swapped in BeReal instead (only 3% of Americans surveyed said they ever use it). The app\u2019s inclusion was exploratory, according to Gottfried, and we\u2019ll be curious to see what makes the cut in 2025 \u2014 maybe Threads or something we haven\u2019t even heard of yet.\n\u201cIt was just one of those ones that was starting to really [become] part of the conversation and we wanted to make sure we started to get a baseline measurement,\u201d Gottfried said.\n\nStudy finds half of Americans get news on social media, but percentage has dropped\n\n",

      "content": "\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO and founder of Meta, commented in today\u2019s Senate hearing on children\u2019s online safety that teenagers should be able to be creators and share their content widely.\nSenator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) questioned Zuckerberg about Meta\u2019s privacy controls for teenagers. On Instagram, for example, teens under 16 \u2014 or 18 in some countries \u2014 have their accounts automatically set to private when they join the platform. But teenagers can toggle these safety measures to make their accounts public at any time.\n\u201cYes, we default teens into a private account so they can have a private and restricted experience,\u201d Zuckerberg told the senator. \u201cBut some teens want to be creators and want to have content that they share more broadly, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that should just blanketly be banned.\u201d\nResearch has shown that becoming a content creator is a dream for many young Americans. In 2019, Morning Consult reported that 86% of teens would consider trying to become an influencer, and that influencers held as much sway as traditional celebrities. For example, as many teens were familiar with the creator PewDiePie as they were with NBA legend LeBron James. When Lego surveyed 3,000 children in 2019, the toy company found that \u201cvlogger\u201d was a more popular dream job for kids than \u201castronaut.\u201d\nSome of the most successful creators started out when they were teenagers, like 19-year-old Charli D\u2019Amelio, a self-made millionaire whose family now has its own venture capital fund. MrBeast, another of the world\u2019s highest earning creators, began posting on YouTube when he was 13.\nOf course, there are safety risks for these young creators, as well as any young person on the internet. But Zuckerberg affirms that their contributions to culture \u2014 and Meta\u2019s bottom line \u2014 are worth it. For a business like Instagram, it\u2019s important to keep talented creators happy on the platform so that their viral content continues to drive ad revenue.\n\u201cThere have been a lot of teens creating amazing things, and I think with the right supervision and parenting and controls\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the type of thing that you want to not allow anyone to be able to do,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\nZuckerberg is one of five tech CEOs who testified before Congress about children\u2019s online safety on Wednesday, including X\u2019s Linda Yaccarino, Discord\u2019s Jason Citron, Snap\u2019s Evan Spiegel, and TikTok\u2019s Shou Chew.\n\nCEOs from Meta, TikTok, Snap, X and Discord head to Congress for kids\u2019 online safety hearing\n\n\nThe creator economy is ready for a workers\u2019 movement\n\n",

      "content": "\nStarlab, the private space station being developed by Voyager Space and Airbus, will go to orbit onboard a SpaceX Starship rocket before the decade is out, the companies announced Wednesday.\nStarlab is one of a handful of private space station initiatives currently under development. These projects have gained major funding from NASA, under a new initiative called the Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program, which is seeking to avoid a critical \u201cspace station gap\u201d when the International Space Station is decommissioned in 2030.\nThe news from Starlab is not exactly a surprise; in a recent interview, Voyager CEO Dylan Taylor said it was always the plan to launch Starlab in a single mission \u2014 and Starship is the only heavy-lift rocket under development that will be capable of accommodating the station\u2019s eight-meter-diameter in one go. Taylor added that the decision to launch in one mission also reduces on-orbit risks.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you have a station that requires multiple launches, and then you\u2019re taking the hardware and you\u2019re assembling it [on orbit],\u201d he said. \u201cNot only is that very costly, but there\u2019s a lot of execution risk around that as well. That\u2019s what we were trying to avoid and we\u2019re convinced that that\u2019s the best way to go.\u201d\nVoyager and Airbus finalized their Starlab joint venture earlier this month after announcing the plans last August, with the partnership leveraging technical expertise from both companies as well as ties to their respective government space agencies (Airbus is headquartered in Germany, while Voyager, via its operating subsidiary Nanoracks, has extensive experience working with NASA). But because Starlab Space LLC is a transatlantic joint venture, the two companies had to complete various closing reviews, like a review with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), Taylor said.\nThe joint venture builds on an earlier partnership between the two companies for Airbus to provide \u201ctechnical support and expertise\u201d for Starlab. While the companies have released scant details about what that expertise includes, Taylor did say that Airbus will be manufacturing the Starlab module in-house \u2014 plus any additional Starlabs the joint venture launches into the future.\nAs of a year ago, Voyager said that Starlab is planned to be launched in 2028; this new announcement on the launch deal with SpaceX included no firm dates, however, and Taylor said the focus is to have Starlab in orbit before the ISS retirement in 2030.\nThe company said it had a series of design reviews coming up this year that will lead into the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) at the end of this year. The PDR is a critical milestone that establishes that the project meets technical, cost and timeline requirements.\nVoyager and its operating subsidiary Nanoracks were awarded a $160 million contract from NASA in December 2021 for the design and development of Starlab; at the time, two other projects \u2014 one led by Blue Origin and another by Northrop Grumman \u2014 also received funding. However, last October Northrop announced it was abandoning its plans to instead of joining forces with Starlab, to develop rendezvous and docking technology and provide cargo resupply with its Cygnus spacecraft. (That spacecraft just lifted off on its 20th resupply mission to the ISS, so Northrop certainly has the bona fides for the job.)\n",

My startup will register me for the H-1B lottery in March, but I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t be selected. What is the latest with how the USCIS will run the H-1B lottery? Plus, I\u2019ve also been reading that the immigration application fees will increase substantially, so I would like my startup to sponsor me for a visa and possibly a green card as soon as possible before the fees go up. What do you recommend?\n\u2014 Frugal Founder\nDear Frugal,\nThanks for reaching out to me with your question. I\u2019ve got you! For an early-stage startup, every decision is critical as Alfonso de la Nuez, an immigrant founder with an $800 million+ acquisition, recently shared with me in my podcast. Check out my video about the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 (USCIS) latest update last night \u2014 the lottery will be more fair for early-stage startups and international students and founders: one person, one chance!\nYou\u2019re right that the USCIS is expected to publish a final rule in the Federal Register this week that will significantly increase application fees. Separately, premium processing fees will also increase in February. The USCIS has confirmed that the H-1B registration fee will remain $10 this year and the lottery will be open March 6 through March 22. You can learn about these updates to the upcoming lottery in our complimentary educational webinar!\nFor those who qualify, getting approval for an O-1A extraordinary ability visa is a relatively quick process, particularly with premium processing. The Biden administration has made qualifying for the O-1A much easier for startup founders in the STEM field. But the O-1A has remained largely unchanged since it was created by the Immigration Act of 1990, so Lindsay Milliken, an immigration fellow at the Institute for Progress (IFP), is pushing for the USCIS to update its O-1A guidance for startup founders, especially in the area of nontraditional achievements.\nThe corollary to the O-1A visa, the EB-1A extraordinary ability green card, generally has the quickest processing time among all the employment-based green cards. Keep in mind the bar is high for qualifying for the EB-1A green card, so many recent grads and first-time founders in the STEM field find success with the EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver), which can take longer due to green card backlogs.\n ",

For instance, \u201cWinning Wheel\u201d picks winners via a randomizer spinning wheel, \u201cMagic Maps\u201d visualizes where participants are streaming from across the world and \u201cWonder Words\u201d involves a presenter asking a question and the responses appear as a word collage. The platform can automatically detect when a question is asked in the chat. Plus, an engagement level meter can be found at the bottom left corner of the screen.\nAt the end of each session, presenters get a list of active participants, which tells them how often they participated, as well as a chart to track the highs and lows of an entire session to see where people were the most or least engaged.\nImage Credits: StreamAlive\nAnyone can make an account for free, however, users can also pay for a subscription to unlock upgrades like unlimited chat-powered interactions and a live training session with StreamAlive\u2019s team, along with more AI-based tools, including using ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas on how to interact with audiences. There are three plans to choose from: Basic ($19/month), Pro ($39/month) and Pro+ ($99/month).\nThe company is also working on bringing \u201cfully AI-generated presentations,\u201d a chat-powered interaction that \u201cclusters similar questions together\u201d and a new way to \u201cautomatically visualize data,\u201d among other upcoming features, co-founder Lux Narayan tells TechCrunch.\n\u201c[For example] if a presenter asks the audience how comfortable on a scale of 1-5 they are with public speaking, once everyone enters their answer in chat, it will automatically average out the data and present that visually so everyone can see the audience\u2019s average comfort level of public speaking,\u201d he adds.\nImage Credits: StreamAlive\nThe concept of going to an office five days a week is more or less dead, and many people agree that hybrid work (in-person and remote) is here to stay. StreamAlive believes it\u2019s more important than ever that employers prevent workers from feeling disconnected when working from home, and the company believes its platform is part of the solution.\n\u201cMost companies are not going to return to fully in-person. Yet, during all-hands meetings or training or presentations, companies need to ensure there is parity between people who are in-person and others who are joining remotely. This means that everyone has the ability to be heard and acknowledged and that enthusiasm and morale don\u2019t drop off when someone is working remotely,\u201d says Narayan.\nSimilarly, when gaming streamers and educators include interactions in their livestreams, it could help convert more passive observers into active participants and, in turn, boost their fanbases or make a lengthy online course more entertaining.\nImage Credits: StreamAlive\nThe idea for StreamAlive came about when Narayan was taking online courses to learn how to write, edit and market his book, \u201cName, Place, Animal, Thing.\u201d He noticed how a lot of the audience\u2019s responses were being ignored in the chat and event hosts struggled to boost, convert and track engagement. StreamAlive became widely available in December 2022 and currently has more than 2,000 users, including teams at Nike, Symphony AI and Persistent Systems. Notably, YouTuber Airrack implemented StreamAlive into his viral three-hour live ping pong competition, using it to track over 365,000 comments.\nNarayan and his co-founders, Joe Varghese and Tina Lyngdoh, were also part of the founding team at Unmetric, the social media intelligence platform acquired by Cision in 2019.\nThe recent round was led by Speciale Invest, with participation from Foster Ventures, former CEO of Match Group Shar Dubey and founder and Chairman of LatentView Analytics Venkat Viswanathan, among others. The company plans to put the new capital toward product development and expanding the engineering and growth teams.\nIn January 2022, StreamAlive raised $1.53 million in a separate pre-seed funding round, which was also backed by Speciale Invest and included angel investors like \u201cthree world-renowned computer science professors at MIT, two CEOs at public companies [and] four CXOs at private tech unicorns,\u201d the company said.\n",

      "content": "\nData has always been at the heart of every program, and even more so these days as data feeds machine learning and large language models, but connecting to those databases has been a constant struggle for developers.\nNeurelo, an early-stage startup, emerged today with a solution to help solve that problem by creating a programming interface that sits between the database and the application. They do this by creating customized APIs based on the individual data model that a developer has built, greatly simplifying the interaction between the database and the application \u2014 and it\u2019s all automated.\nThe company has raised $5 million in seed funding to build on this vision.\nCo-founder and CEO Chirag Shah previously spent time at MongoDB, where he was in charge of the database company\u2019s product team. It was there where he learned directly from developers the problems they faced solving this issue.\n\u201cWe realized that the third bastion of database evolution is this programming interface because that\u2019s where all the problems still remain,\u201d Shah told TechCrunch. Some larger tech companies like Facebook with the means and engineering resources solved this issue with customized programming interfaces, but it was really out of reach for most developers. Shah and co-founder and CTO Guru Kamat, who came from Stripe, wanted to fix that, perhaps not surprisingly with APIs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not building a database. We\u2019re building this abstraction layer that absolutely gives developers every single read and write you want from your software for your data, for your database. You get that as a purpose-built API for your data model, and it unlocks all the complexities and simplifies all the complexities as you go into production for performance scale,\u201d he said.\nIt is these customized APIs based on the individual data model, whether gaming or e-commerce or whatever the application happens to be, that makes this unique. It\u2019s creating these APIs between the database and the programming interface. For developers who want to see what that means, the company also gives visibility into each API, rather than presenting it as a black box.\nImage Credits: Neurelo\nThere is also a dose of generative AI here as database queries are generated automatically with a custom large language model, designed specifically to understand the nuances of different databases and their associated query languages.\nThe company launched in August 2022. The founders left their jobs on a Friday and had a term sheet for the $5 million seed round in hand by the following week, giving them confidence and validation that they were solving a big problem.\nThe seven-person engineering team came together by December, and the company spent the first nine months of last year building a beta of the product. Today the company has 12 people on the team, with plans to hire a few more in the coming months; the product is generally available starting today.\nThe $5 million seed was led by Foundation Capital with participation from Cortical Ventures, Secure Octane Investments and Aviso Ventures.\n",

      "content": "\nTesla has been sued by 25 California counties alleging the automaker has repeatedly mishandled hazardous waste at facilities throughout the state. The lawsuit was filed after months of settlement talks apparently fell apart.\nThe complaint, filed in San Joaquin County Superior Court, states that Tesla improperly labeled and disposed of materials like \u201clead acid batteries and other batteries,\u201d paints, brake fluid, aerosols, antifreeze, acetone, diesel fuel and more at its production and service facilities throughout the state. Tesla also allegedly improperly disposed of the waste, both on-site and at landfills that can\u2019t accept hazardous waste.\nThe district attorneys in each county are seeking an injunction to force Tesla to properly handle the waste at the facilities going forward as well as civil penalties. Tesla could be on the hook for as much as $70,000 per violation per day, according to Reuters, which first reported the suit.\nTesla first revealed in a 2022 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was being investigated by district attorney offices from around the state of California over its waste management practices. The company said it \u201chad implemented various remedial measures, including conducting training and audits, and enhancements to its site waste management programs.\u201d\nIn October 2023, the company said it was in settlement talks with those district attorney offices. The lawsuit suggests those talks ended without a resolution. Representatives for the San Francisco and San Joaquin District Attorney\u2019s offices, which led the investigation, did not immediately answer a question about what happened to the settlement talks.\nTesla has previously been scrutinized for the environmental impact of the work it does in California. The company settled with the Environmental Protection Agency in 2019 over a number of violations at its Fremont, California factory, one of which included the labeling of hazardous waste. That resulted in a $31,000 fine and a $55,000 layout to cover the cost of emergency response equipment for first responders. Tesla also paid a $275,000 fine in 2022 for violating the Clean Air Act at the same factory.\n",

      "content": "\nAutonomous vehicle company Motional is losing capital support from one of its primary backers as it aims to commercialize a robotaxi service in 2024.\nAutomotive supplier Aptiv \u2014 the other half of a $4 billion joint venture with Hyundai that created Motional \u2014 said Wednesday it will no longer allocate capital toward the endeavor.\n\u201cWhile our Motional joint venture continues to make progress on their technology roadmap, we\u2019ve decided to no longer allocate capital to Motional and are pursuing alternatives to further reduce our ownership interest,\u201d Aptiv Chairman and CEO Kevin Clark said during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call Wednesday.\n\u201cThe costs related to delivering the tech principally, in and around hardware, really makes it challenging from an adoption standpoint in the mobility on-demand market,\u201d Clark said.\nIn other words, standing up a robotaxi service is costly and the timeline of recapturing those precious dollars is too long for Aptiv to wait.\nAptiv CFO Joe Massaro later added that the company is \u201cexploring steps to reduce a significant portion of our common equity while working within the construct of the joint venture agreement.\u201d The exact timing of the reduction is not yet known, he said.\nMotional, which operates an autonomous vehicle taxi service in Las Vegas (still with human safety operators behind the wheel) on Uber, Lyft and Via platforms, downplayed Aptiv\u2019s announcement in its quarterly earnings call.\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident in our funding roadmap and are well-positioned for the next phase of our commercialization,\u201d an emailed statement from the company reads. \u201cOur team is focused on scaling our driverless services, expanding Motional\u2019s commercial partnerships and furthering development on Motional\u2019s next-generation robotaxi in collaboration with Kia. Aptiv and the Hyundai Motor Group remain Motional shareholders, and there are no ownership updates at this time. Motional is uniquely positioned through our strategic partnerships with our shareholders, and we continue to have their strong support and collaboration.\u201d\nMotional roots\nMotional wasn\u2019t manifested in an Aptiv and Hyundai board meeting.\nIn 2013, Karl Iagnemma and Emilio Frazzoli founded nuTonomy, a Boston-based autonomous vehicle startup that was one of the first to successfully test the technology on public roads. Automotive parts supplier Delphi acquired nuTonomy in 2017 for $450 million. Delphi would later split into two companies: its powertrain business became Delphi Technologies, while Aptiv would focus on the design and production of electronic systems, advanced safety technology and the hardware and software required for autonomous vehicles. nuTonomy was absorbed into Aptiv.\nTwo years later as the hype and promise around autonomous vehicles peaked, Hyundai and Aptiv formed a joint venture \u2014 later branded Motional \u2014 to commercialize self-driving cars. Iagnemma, who had been president of Aptiv\u2019s autonomous mobility group, was picked to head up Motional.\nAt the time, the companies said the combined investment in the joint venture would total $4 billion in aggregate value, including the value of combined engineering services, R&D and IP. Aptiv agreed to bring its autonomous driving technology and about 700 employees, while Hyundai Motor Group said it would provide a combined $1.6 billion in cash from across its sub-brands, vehicle engineering, R&D and access to its IP.\nIts aim was to begin testing its AVs in 2020 and commercialize the tech by 2022, a target that now seems outlandish, but was in step with the rest of a nascent and bullish industry. Motional, along with the rest of the industry, has since adjusted its commercial targets.\nAnd the company has made some progress toward its goal of launching a robotaxi service using driverless Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles in 2024. In November, Hyundai Motor Group and Motional announced plans to co-develop production-ready versions of the all-electric Ioniq 5 robotaxi at the automaker\u2019s new innovation center in Singapore, the Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center Singapore (HMGICS). A production-ready autonomous vehicle, equipped with the kind of redundancies designed for safe operations without a human driver, is a critical milestone required for commercial operations.\nThe company is testing its autonomous vehicles \u2014 always with human safety operators behind the wheel \u2014 in Boston, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Singapore. It is also operating an autonomous delivery service in Los Angeles with Uber Eats. During CES 2024, the company announced plans to work with Kia on a next-generation vehicle that will enter commercial operations later this decade. The initial development process will begin this year, according to the company.\n",

They, and now two other supervisors, have made police reports.\nPeskin spoke to TechCrunch about the letter, which he quoted from: \u201cI wish a slow, painful death for you and your loved ones.\u201d The front of the letter had a photo of Tan, who last weekend posted a tweet addressing seven San Francisco supervisors who oversee the delivery of local government services.\nIt read,\u00a0 \u201cFuck Chan Peskin Preston Walton Melgar Ronen Safai Chan as a label and motherfucking crew \u2026 And if you are down with Peskin Preston Walton Melgar Ronen Safai Chan as a crew fuck you too \u2026 Die slow motherfuckers.\u201d\nFollowing the post and a few other comments, Tan apologized, writing that he \u201cthought everyone would get the rap reference but that wasn\u2019t a good call, reference or not \u2013 sorry!\u201d The reference in question was the 1996 Tupac Shakur song \u201cHit \u2018Em Up.\u201d\nTo be clear, Peskin does not think the threatening letter he received came from Tan. He believes it was actually from someone who has sent similar threatening letters to the supervisors previously.\nPeskin, along with four other of the board\u2019s Jewish members, received anti-semitic postcards in the mail in October, Peskin said. He shared some of the verbiage from that correspondence, which reads, \u201cThis letter was sent to educate public servants. It was without malicious intent.\u201d\nThe bottom of the recent letter said, \u201cThis mail was sent to communicate a political opinion. No threats were intended.\u201d\nPeskin has not met Tan personally. However, he said he was one of the San Francisco politicians Tan called out in this YouTube video over his criticism of Cruise bringing its autonomous car to the city. Ultimately, Cruise lost its permit to operate in California following an October accident involving a pedestrian.\nMeanwhile, Tan\u2019s now-deleted X post did \u201charm to democratic discourse,\u201d Peskin said.\n\u201cI\u2019m attempting to draw a very bright line and say that it is unacceptable and that it is damaging to democracy,\u201d Peskin said. \u201cHim taking the tweet down and apologizing on Twitter doesn\u2019t leave me, or more importantly, San Franciscans with the feeling that this guy has learned something, or that he truly understands the gravity of what he\u2019s done in the moment that we are living in.\u201d\nAttempts to reach Tan via Y Combinator were not answered at the time of publication.\n",
