      "title": "The Taylor Swift deepfake debacle was frustratingly preventable",
      "content": "\nYou know you\u2019ve screwed up when you\u2019ve simultaneously angered the White House, the TIME Person of the Year and pop culture\u2019s most rabid fanbase. That\u2019s what happened last week to X, the Elon Musk-owned platform formerly called Twitter, when AI-generated, pornographic deepfake images of Taylor Swift went viral.\nOne of the most widespread posts of the nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes was viewed more than 45 million times, with hundreds of thousands of likes. That doesn\u2019t even factor in all the accounts that reshared the images in separate posts \u2014 once an image has been circulated that widely, it\u2019s basically impossible to remove.\nX lacks the infrastructure to identify abusive content quickly and at scale. Even in the Twitter days, this issue was difficult to remedy, but it\u2019s become much worse since Musk gutted so much of Twitter\u2019s staff, including the majority of its trust and safety teams. So, Taylor Swift\u2019s massive and passionate fanbase took matters into their own hands, flooding search results for queries like \u201ctaylor swift ai\u201d and \u201ctaylor swift deepfake\u201d to make it more difficult for users to find the abusive images. As the White House\u2019s press secretary called on Congress to do something, X simply banned the search term \u201ctaylor swift\u201d for a few days. When users searched the musician\u2019s name, they would see a notice that an error had occurred.\nThis content moderation failure became a national news story, since Taylor Swift is Taylor Swift. But if social platforms can\u2019t protect one of the most famous women in the world, who can they protect?\n\u201cIf you have what happened to Taylor Swift happen to you, as it\u2019s been happening to so many people, you\u2019re likely not going to have the same amount of support based on clout, which means you won\u2019t have access to these really important communities of care,\u201d Dr. Carolina Are, a fellow at Northumbria University\u2019s Centre for Digital Citizens in the U.K., told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd these communities of care are what most users are having to resort to in these situations, which really shows you the failure of content moderation.\u201d\nBanning the search term \u201ctaylor swift\u201d is like putting a piece of Scotch tape on a burst pipe. There are many obvious workarounds, like how TikTok users search for \u201cseggs\u201d instead of sex. The search block was something that X could implement to make it look like they\u2019re doing something, but it doesn\u2019t stop people from just searching \u201ct swift\u201d instead. Copia Institute and Techdirt founder Mike Masnick called the effort \u201ca sledge hammer version of trust & safety.\u201d\n\u201cPlatforms suck when it comes to giving women, non-binary people and queer people agency over their bodies, so they replicate offline systems of abuse and patriarchy,\u201d Are said. \u201cIf your moderation systems are incapable of reacting in a crisis, or if your moderation systems are incapable of reacting to users\u2019 needs when they\u2019re reporting that something is wrong, we have a problem.\u201d\nSo, what should X have done to prevent the Taylor Swift fiasco?\nAre asks these questions as part of her research, and proposes that social platforms need a complete overhaul of how they handle content moderation. Recently, she conducted a series of roundtable discussions with 45 internet users from around the world who are impacted by censorship and abuse to issue recommendations to platforms about how to enact change.\nOne recommendation is for social media platforms to be more transparent with individual users about decisions regarding their account or their reports about other accounts.\n\u201cYou have no access to a case record, even though platforms do have access to that material \u2014 they just don\u2019t want to make it public,\u201d Are said. \u201cI think when it comes to abuse, people need a more personalized, contextual and speedy response that involves, if not face-to-face help, at least direct communication.\u201d\nX announced this week that it would hire 100 content moderators to work out of a new \u201cTrust and Safety\u201d center in Austin, Texas. But under Musk\u2019s purview, the platform has not set a strong precedent for protecting marginalized users from abuse. It can also be challenging to take Musk at face value, as the mogul has a long track record of failing to deliver on his promises. When he first bought Twitter, Musk declared he would form a content moderation council before making major decisions. This did not happen.\nIn the case of AI-generated deepfakes, the onus is not just on social platforms. It\u2019s also on the companies that create consumer-facing generative AI products.\nAccording to an investigation by 404 Media, the abusive depictions of Swift came from a Telegram group devoted to creating nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes. The members of the group often use Microsoft Designer, which draws from OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 to generate images based on inputted prompts. In a loophole that Microsoft has since addressed, users could generate images of celebrities by writing prompts like \u201ctaylor \u2018singer\u2019 swift\u201d or \u201cjennifer \u2018actor\u2019 aniston.\u201d\nA principal software engineering lead at Microsoft, Shane Jones, wrote a letter to the Washington state attorney general stating that he found vulnerabilities in DALL-E 3 in December, which made it possible to \u201cbypass some of the guardrails that are designed to prevent the model from creating and distributing harmful images.\u201d\nJones alerted Microsoft and OpenAI to the vulnerabilities, but after two weeks, he had received no indication that the issues were being addressed. So, he posted an open letter on LinkedIn to urge OpenAI to suspend the availability of DALL-E 3. Jones alerted Microsoft to his letter, but he was swiftly asked to take it down.\n\u201cWe need to hold companies accountable for the safety of their products and their responsibility to disclose known risks to the public,\u201d Jones wrote in his letter to the state attorney general. \u201cConcerned employees, like myself, should not be intimidated into staying silent.\u201d\nOpenAI told TechCrunch that it immediately investigated Jones\u2019 report and found that the technique he outlined did not bypass its safety systems.\n\u201cIn the underlying DALL-E 3 model, we\u2019ve worked to filter the most explicit content from its training data including graphic sexual and violent content, and have developed robust image classifiers that steer the model away from generating harmful images,\u201d a spokesperson from OpenAI said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also implemented additional safeguards for our products, ChatGPT and the DALL-E API \u2013 including declining requests that ask for a public figure by name.\u201d\nOpenAI added that it uses external red teaming to test products for misuse. It\u2019s still not confirmed if Microsoft\u2019s program is responsible for the explicit Swift deepfakes, but the fact stands that as of last week, both journalists and bad actors on Telegram were able to use this software to generate images of celebrities.\nAs the world\u2019s most influential companies bet big on AI, platforms need to take a proactive approach to regulate abusive content \u2014 but even in an era when making celebrity deepfakes wasn\u2019t so easy, violative behavior easily evaded moderation.\n\u201cIt really shows you that platforms are unreliable,\u201d Are said. \u201cMarginalized communities have to trust their followers and fellow users more than the people that are technically in charge of our safety online.\u201d\nUpdated, 1/30/24 at 10:30 PM ET, with comment from OpenAI\n\nSwift retaliation: Fans strike back after explicit deepfakes flood X\n\n",

      "title": "ChatGPT users can now invoke GPTs directly in chats",
      "content": "\nOpenAI is pushing adoption of GPTs, third-party apps powered by its AI models, by enabling ChatGPT users to invoke them in any chat.\nStarting today, paid users of ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s AI chatbot front end, can bring GPTs into a conversation by typing \u201c@\u201d and selecting a GPT from the list. The chosen GPT will have an understanding of the full conversation, and different GPTs can be \u201ctagged in\u201d for different use cases and needs \u2014 jumping into the conversation with context of things that were said previously.\n\u201cThis allows you to add relevant GPTs with the full context of the conversation,\u201d OpenAI said in a tweet.\n\n\nYou can now bring GPTs into any conversation in ChatGPT \u2013 simply type @ and select the GPT. \nThis allows you to add relevant GPTs with the full context of the conversation. pic.twitter.com/Pjn5uIy9NF\n\u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) January 30, 2024\n\nThe move to make GPTs more discoverable comes weeks after the launch of the GPT Store, a marketplace for GPTs accessible through the ChatGPT dashboard. Building GPTs doesn\u2019t require coding experience, and GPTs can be as simple or complex as a developer wishes. A few available today include a trail recommender from AllTrails, a code tutor from Khan Academy and a content designer from Canva.\nOpenAI plans to eventually introduce monetization for developers who wish to sell access to their GPTs. But the company might have to get traffic up first. According to data from Similarweb, the web analytics company, custom GPTs comprise only about 2.7% of ChatGPT\u2019s worldwide web traffic so far \u2014 and custom GPT traffic has been declining month over month since November.\nModeration is proving to be another challenge. In the first week of its launch, the GPT Store was flooded with \u201cromantic\u201d chatbots apps, some of which were sexually suggestive \u2014 a clear violation of OpenAI\u2019s terms. Developers also rushed to make political campaigning bots \u2014 like a chatbot that impersonated U.S. presidential candidate Dean Phillips \u2014 another obvious violation.\nOpenAI, which claims to use a combination of human and automated review to flag GPTs, has since removed some of the offending apps. But if the volume of GPTs grows as the company\u2019s clearly hoping, one imagines that the problem is only going to become more acute.\n",

      "title": "ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot",
      "content": "\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s firing and swift return\u00a0raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.\nWhat does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.\nWhile there is a more\u2026nefarious side to ChatGPT, it\u2019s clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it. \nPrior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (a super-charged version of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model) and a multimodal API. OpenAI also unveiled the GPT store, where users could create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT. Though the launch was delayed in December, it officially launched in January.\nGPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year.

The report alleges that AI tools like ChatGPT are being prominently used by cybercriminals to write compelling and sophisticated phishing emails.\nSouth Africa officials investigate if President Cyril Ramaphosa used ChatGPT to write a speech\nFollowing speculation, social media users fed portions of Ramaphosa\u2019s November 21 speech in Johannesburg through AI detectors, alleging parts of it may have been written with ChatGPT. South African presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya refuted the claims, and local officials are investigating.\nChatGPT Voice can be used to replace Siri\nNow that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Voice feature is available to all free users, it can be used to replace Siri on an iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max by configuring the new Action Button. The new feature lets you ask ChatGPT questions and listen to its responses \u2014 like a much smarter version of Siri.\nSam Altman returns as CEO\nAltman\u2019s return came swiftly, with an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d announced between him and OpenAI\u2019s board that will reinstate him as CEO and restructure the board to include new members, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.\nChatGPT Voice rolls out to all free users\nEven if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the \u201cheadphones\u201d icon.\nSam Altman might return, but it\u2019s complicated\nThe only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.\n\u201cObviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they\u2019re not going to be in OpenAI,\u201d Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was \u201copen\u201d to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.\nConfirmation Sam Altman will not return as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\nA number of investors and OpenAI employees tried to bring back Altman after his sudden firing by the company\u2019s board, but following a weekend of negotiations, it was confirmed that Altman would not return to OpenAI and new leadership would take hold. What this means for ChatGPT\u2019s future, and for the OpenAI Dev Day announcements, remains to be seen.\nSam Altman ousted as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\nSam Altman has been fired from OpenAI. He will leave the company\u2019s board and step down as CEO, with OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer Mira Murati stepping in as interim CEO. In a blog post from OpenAI, the company writes that the board \u201cno longer has confidence in [Altman\u2019s] ability to continue leading OpenAI.\u201d\nIn a statement on X, Altman said working at OpenAI \u201cwas transformative\u201d for him and \u201chopefully the world.\u201d\nOpenAI explores how ChatGPT can be used in the classroom\nOpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed at a San Francisco conference that the company will likely create a team to identify ways AI and ChatGPT can be used in education. This announcement comes at a time when ChatGPT is being criticized by educators for encouraging cheating, resulting in bans in certain school districts.\nOpenAI pauses new ChatGPT Plus subscriptions due to a \u201csurge of usage\u201d\nFollowing OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day conference, Sam Altman announced the company is putting a pause on new subscriptions for its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. The temporary hold on sign-ups, as well as the demand for ChatGPT Plus\u2019 new features like making custom GPTS, has led to a slew of resellers on eBay.\nChatGPT gets flagged as potentially unsafe for kids\nAn independent review from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that\u00a0 ChatGPT could potentially be harmful for younger users. ChatGPT got an overall three-star rating in the report, with its lowest ratings relating to transparency, privacy, trust and safety.\u00a0\nOpenAI blames DDoS attack for ChatGPT outage\nOpenAI confirmed that a DDoS attack was behind outages affecting ChatGPT and its developer tools. ChatGPT experienced sporadic outages for about 24 hours, resulting in users being unable to log into or use the service.\nOpenAI debuts GPT-4 Turbo\nOpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that\u2019s strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.\nGPT-4 gets a fine-tuning\nAs opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says \u2014 largely due to technical hurdles.\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT Store lets you build (and monetize) your own GPT\nUsers and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI\u2019s marketplace and monetize it in the future.\nChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users\nAfter being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.\nOpenAI launches DALL-E 3 API, new text-to-speech models\nDALL-E 3, OpenAI\u2019s text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI\u2019s newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.\nOpenAI promises to defend business customers against copyright claims\nBowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don\u2019t extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.\nAs OpenAI\u2019s multimodal API launches broadly, research shows it\u2019s still flawed\nOpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.\nOpenAI launches API, letting developers build \u2018assistants\u2019 into their apps\nAt its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build \u201cagent-like experiences\u201d within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.\nOctober 2023\nChatGPT app revenue shows no signs of slowing, but it\u2019s not #1\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it\u2019s surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like\u00a0 \u201cChat & Ask AI\u201d and \u201cChatOn \u2014 AI Chat Bot Assistant\u201d, are actually making more money than ChatGPT.\nChatGPT tests the ability to upload and analyze files for Plus users\nSubscribers to ChatGPT\u2019s Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.\nChatGPT officially gets web search\nOpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.\nOpenAI integrates DALL-E 3 into ChatGPT\nThe integration means users don\u2019t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.\nMicrosoft-affiliated research finds flaws in GPT-4\nA Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d \u2014 and toxicity \u2014 of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of \u201cjailbreaking\u201d prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile app hits record $4.58M in revenue in September\nOpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September. But revenue growth has now begun to slow, according to new data from market intelligence firm Appfigures \u2014 dropping from 30% to 20% in September.\nSeptember 2023\nChatGPT can now browse the internet (again)\nOpenAI posted on Twitter/X that ChatGPT can now browse the internet and is no longer limited to data before September 2021. The chatbot had a web browsing capability for Plus subscribers back in July, but the feature was taken away after users exploited it to get around paywalls.\n\nChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. pic.twitter.com/pyj8a9HWkB\n\u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 27, 2023\n\nChatGPT now has a voice\nOpenAI announced that it\u2019s adding a new voice for verbal conversations and image-based smarts to the AI-powered chatbot.\nPoland opens an investigation against OpenAI\nThe Polish authority publically announced it has opened an investigation regarding ChatGPT \u2014 accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nOpenAI unveils DALL-E 3\nThe upgraded text-to-image tool, DALL-E 3, uses ChatGPT to help fill in prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI\u2019s premium ChatGPT plans, ChatGPT Plus\u00a0and\u00a0ChatGPT Enterprise, can type in a request for an image and hone it through conversations with the chatbot \u2014 receiving the results directly within the chat app.\nOpera GX integrates ChatGPT-powered AI\nPowered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, the AI browser Aria\u00a0launched on Opera in May to give users an easier way to search, ask questions and write code. Today, the company announced it is bringing Aria to Opera GX, a version of the flagship Opera browser that is built for gamers.\nThe new feature allows Opera GX users to interact directly with a browser AI to find the latest gaming news and tips.\nAugust 2023\nOpenAI releases a guide for teachers using ChatGPT in the classroom\nOpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system\u2019s image a bit when it comes to education, as ChatGPT has been controversial in the classroom due to plagiarism. OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Enterprise\nChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds \u201centerprise-grade\u201d privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.\nSurvey finds relatively few American use ChatGPT\nRecent Pew polling suggests the language model isn\u2019t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.\nOpenAI brings fine-tuning to GPT-3.5 Turbo\nWith fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company\u2019s API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model\u2019s ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the \u201cfeel\u201d of the model\u2019s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.\nOpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.\nFine-tuning costs:\n\nTraining: $0.008 / 1K tokens\nUsage input: $0.012 / 1K tokens\nUsage output: $0.016 / 1K tokens\n\nOpenAI acquires Global Illumination\nIn OpenAI\u2019s first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited for the impact they\u2019ll have here at OpenAI,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a brief\u00a0post published to its official blog. \u201cThe entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.\u201d\nThe \u2018custom instructions\u2019 feature is extended to free ChatGPT users\nOpenAI announced that it\u2019s expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service.

DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),\u201d Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. \u201cBased on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.\u201d\nJuly 2023\nChatGPT for Android is now available in the US, India, Bangladesh and Brazil\nA few days after putting up\u00a0a preorder page\u00a0on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and\u00a0released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.\nChatGPT is coming to Android\nChatGPT is available to \u201cpre-order\u201d for Android users.\nThe ChatGPT app on Android\u00a0looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version\u2019s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too \u2014 so if you\u2019re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.\nOpenAI launches customized instructions for ChatGPT\nOpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don\u2019t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.\nThe company said this feature lets you \u201cshare anything you\u2019d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.\u201d For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.\nThe FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI\nThe FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI\u2019s flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made \u201cfalse, misleading, disparaging or harmful\u201d statements about people.\nTechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:\nThis kind of investigation doesn\u2019t just appear out of thin air \u2014 the FTC doesn\u2019t look around and say \u201cThat looks suspicious.\u201d Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there\u2019s evidence the company lied about the side effects.\nOpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4\nStarting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers \u201cwith a history of successful payments\u201d can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.\nIn the future, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and\u00a0GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI\u2019s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.\nJune 2023\nChatGPT app can now search the web only on Bing\nOpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.\nThe Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting \u201cGPT-4\u201d in the model switcher and choosing \u201cBrowse with Bing\u201d from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.\nMercedes is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment system\nU.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car\u2019s conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car \u201cHey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not really clear what for, though.\nChatGPT app is now available on iPad, adds support for Siri and Shortcuts\nThe new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.\nOn iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet\u2019s interface.\nMay 2023\nTexas judge orders all AI-generated content must be declared and checked\nThe Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that \u201cno portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,\u201d or if it was, that it was checked \u201cby a human being.\u201d\nChatGPT app expanded to more than 30 countries\nThe list of new countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.\nChatGPT app is now available in 11 more countries\nOpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store.

More to come soon!\n\u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 24, 2023\n\nOpenAI launches a ChatGPT app for iOS\nChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.\nWhen using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices \u2014 meaning it will know what you\u2019ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with\u00a0Whisper, OpenAI\u2019s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.\nHackers are using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on Facebook\nMeta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users\u2019 devices.\n\u201cIn one case, we\u2019ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,\u201d said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in\u00a0a blog post. \u201cThey would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.\u201d\nApril 2023\nChatGPT parent company OpenAI closes $300M share sale at $27B-29B valuation\nVC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft\u2019s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.\nOpenAI previews new subscription tier, ChatGPT Business\nCalled ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as \u201cfor professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.\u201d\n\u201cChatGPT Business will follow our API\u2019s data usage policies, which means that end users\u2019 data won\u2019t be used to train our models by default,\u201d OpenAI\u00a0wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.\u201d\nOpenAI wants to trademark \u201cGPT\u201d\nOpenAI applied\u00a0for a trademark for \u201cGPT,\u201d which stands for \u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer,\u201d last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the \u201cmyriad infringements and counterfeit apps\u201d beginning to spring into existence.\nUnfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was\u00a0dismissed\u00a0last week. According to the agency, OpenAI\u2019s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide \u201cappropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.\u201d\nThat means a decision could take up to five more months.\nAuto-GPT is Silicon Valley\u2019s latest quest to automate everything\nAuto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI\u2019s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to \u201cautonomously\u201d perform tasks.\nDepending on what objective the tool\u2019s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very\u2026 unexpected ways. One Reddit\u00a0user\u00a0claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running \u2014 and then \u201ckilled\u201d itself.\nFTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could \u2018turbocharge\u2019 fraud\nFTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud in a congressional hearing.\n\u201cAI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,\u201d Khan told the House representatives. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We\u2019ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,\u201d she stated.\nSuperchat\u2019s new AI chatbot lets you message historical and fictional characters via ChatGPT\nThe company behind the popular iPhone customization app\u00a0Brass, sticker maker\u00a0StickerHub\u00a0and\u00a0others\u00a0is out today with a new AI chat app called\u00a0SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat\u2019s AI features.\nItaly gives OpenAI to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order\nItaly\u2019s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the\u00a0end of last month \u2014 when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU\u2019s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals\u2019 data.\nThe DPA has given OpenAI a deadline \u2014 of April 30 \u2014 to get the regulator\u2019s compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)\nResearchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxic\nA study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a \u201cpersona\u201d \u2014 for example, \u201ca bad person,\u201d \u201ca horrible person\u201d or \u201ca nasty person\u201d \u2014 through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity \u2014 with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.\nThe research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\nY Combinator-backed startups are trying to build \u2018ChatGPT for X\u2019\nYC Demo Day\u2019s Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building \u201cChatGPT for X.\u201d They\u2019re all chasing after a customer service software market that\u2019ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.\nHere are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:\n\nYuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.\nBaselit, which uses one of OpenAI\u2019s text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.\nLasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they\u2019d like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.\nBerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.\n\nItaly orders ChatGPT to be blocked\nOpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.\nItaly\u2019s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do\u00a0have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has\u00a0ordered OpenAI to stop processing people\u2019s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it\u2019s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.\nMarch 2023\n1,100+ signatories signed an open letter asking all \u2018AI labs to immediately pause for 6 months\u2019\nThe letter\u2019s signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on \u201call AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.\u201d\nThe letter reads:\nContemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.\nOpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internet\nOpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot\u2019s functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web.

Customers, who must already be \u201cMicrosoft managed customers and partners,\u201d can apply here for special access.\nOpenAI launches an API for ChatGPT\nOpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat\u2019s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.\nFebruary 2023\nMicrosoft launches the new Bing, with ChatGPT built in\nAt a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences.\nOther companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord \u2014 putting the pressure on Big Tech\u2019s AI initiatives, like Google.\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Plus, starting at $20 per month\nAfter ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A month prior, OpenAI posted a waitlist for \u201cChatGPT Professional\u201d as the company began to think about monetizing the chatbot.\nJanuary 2023\nOpenAI teases ChatGPT Professional\nOpenAI said that it\u2019s \u201cstarting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT\u201d in an announcement on the company\u2019s official Discord server. According to a waitlist link OpenAI posted in Discord, the monetized version will be called ChatGPT Professional. The waitlist document includes the benefits of this new paid version of the chatbot which include no \u201cblackout\u201d windows, no throttling and an unlimited number of messages with ChatGPT \u2014 \u201cat least 2x the regular daily limit.\u201d\nDecember 2022\nShareGPT lets you easily share your ChatGPT conversations\nA week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers \u2014 Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston \u2014 made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI\u2019s answers with the world.\nNovember 2022\nChatGPT first launched to the public as OpenAI quietly released GPT-3.5\nGPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that\u2019s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.\nFAQs:\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\nWho uses ChatGPT?\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.\u00a0 And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ChatGPT and Bard?\nMuch like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.\nChatGPT\u2019s generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been \u201clearning\u201d for a longer period of time than Bard.\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\nYes.\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\nYes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Bard and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to run today.\nThe Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from\u00a0AlphaGo, DeepMind\u2019s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.\nApple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as \u201cApple GPT,\u201d but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\nOpenAI has\u00a0said\u00a0that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out\u00a0this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here\u00a0for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\nWho owns the copyright on ChatGPT-created content or media?\nThe user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\n",

      "content": "\nMasterClass rival Studio launched today its first AI-powered online school for musicians, songwriters and producers to learn from top artists in the industry, create new songs, get feedback from like-minded peers and access Studio\u2019s AI coach that keeps them on track with personalized schedules and deadlines.\nThe waitlist is officially open starting today. Studio offers two pricing options: $199 per month or $1,799 per year.\nStudio\u2019s Music School provides thousands of exclusive lessons taught by more than 110 popular artists and instructors, including Charlie Puth, Kygo, H.E.R., Idina Menzel, Pentatonix, Ryan Tedder (frontman for OneRepublic), Alexander 23, Tainy, Chelsea Cutler, Jonas Blue, Shane McAnally and Louis Bell, among others.\nThere are more than 100 topics to choose from, such as vocal production, songwriting, music business, sound design, music theory, cover songs and musical theater, as well as genres like alternative, classical, country, EDM, folk, hip-hop, indie pop, lo-fi, metal, R&B and more.\nThe online accelerator features an AI-powered coach that leverages OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 to deliver personalized curriculums every month based on someone\u2019s interests, specific goals, learning style and level of experience. It can also design the curriculum around a student\u2019s specific schedule and commitment level, so if they have a vacation, the AI coach will work around that to ensure they still make progress. Students can input a set number of hours to dedicate to their lessons.\nStudents are then assigned custom-built projects, and at the end of the month, they\u2019ll leave with at least one finished, release-ready song.\nImage Credits: Studio\nIn addition to GPT-4, the AI coach is powered by two proprietary frameworks, which address \u201cGPT-4\u2019s main limitations out-of-the-box when it comes to educational design: long-term planning, pacing, sequencing, and effective personalization,\u201d co-founder Max Deutsch explains to TechCrunch. \u201cGPT-4 especially struggles in educational design for creative fields, like music, where there aren\u2019t single \u201ccorrect answers\u201d for each step of the process.\u201d\nThe frameworks leverage Studio\u2019s thousands of hours of video lessons, the expertise of Studio\u2019s curriculum design team and years\u2019 worth of outcome-based student data to determine which lessons, projects and peer matchings yield the best results for different types of learners.\n\u201cThe combination of GPT-4 and these frameworks allow us to build highly effective, well-paced, well-sequenced and correctly personalized curriculums for our students and to proactively and effectively update these plans as students progress to keep them on track and motivated,\u201d Deutsch added.\nLastly, there\u2019s an algorithm that matches students with a 20-person peer group based on similar preferences, so they get weekly feedback from people who are knowledgeable of the same topics.\nIt should be noted that Studio\u2019s Music School isn\u2019t designed for beginners looking to start a career in the music industry but for creatives who already know the basics and want to enhance their skills. While no equipment is required to participate in classes, Studio says that most people already have some kind of music software or DAW (Digital Audio Workstations) and mics to record music.\nDeutsch tells us the online course platform is launching more AI-powered schools later this year, focusing on various areas like writing, filmmaking and design.\nIn 2017, Studio was founded with creatives in mind, filling a gap in the creative learning space where subjects like music, performing arts and baking tend to get overlooked. The company now offers classes to more than 1 million students.\nStudio has raised $60 million to date from a significant number of investors, including Forerunner Ventures, Human Capital, Greenoaks Capital, Floodgate, Jeffrey Katzenberg\u2019s WndrCo, Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, LinkedIn chairman Jeff Weiner, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger, StitchFix founder Katrina Lake, Yelp founder Jeremy Stoppelman, Intuit founder Scott Cook, Zillow founder Spencer Rascoff and more.\n\n",

      "title": "Kore.ai, a startup building conversational AI for enterprises, raises $150M",
      "content": "\nIn the midst of a wave of tech industry layoffs, it\u2019s heartening to see some startups succeeding despite the dour market outlook.\nKore.ai, a company developing enterprise-focused conversational AI and GenAI products, today announced that it raised $150 million in a funding round led by FTV Capital, Nvidia, Vistara Growth, Sweetwater PE, NextEquity, Nicola and Beedie. Bringing the company\u2019s total raised to ~$223 million, the new cash will be put toward product development and scaling up Kore.ai\u2019s workforce, co-founder and CEO Raj Koneru told me in an interview.\nKoneru started Kore.ai in 2014 after launching Kony, a mobile app development startup, and several other small companies, including iTouchPoint (an outsourcing firm) and Intelligroup (a tech consultancy). He says he was inspired to found Kore.ai after seeing the potential of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) along the lines of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, to transform user experiences.\n\u201cWith the introduction of GenAI and LLMs, the tech landscape turned out to be very chaotic and uncertain due to rapid advancements,\u201d Koneru said via email. \u201cThere were more questions than answers \u2026 but I saw conversational AI and LLMs as an opportunity to innovate.\u201d\nGenAI being a newer discipline, Kore.ai wasn\u2019t developing GenAI products in 2014 per se. But Koneru says that the company was laying the foundations for GenAI products to come \u2014 investing heavily in text-generating and text-analyzing models.\nSo how\u2019s Kore.ai innovating? Well, as Koneru describes it, the startup provides a no-code platform to help companies power various \u201cbusiness interactions\u201d via AI \u2014 essentially any customer-to-employee or employee-to-employee interaction over the phone or text (think support chats with an IT/HR service desk). Kore.ai offers workflows and tools designed to give companies in industries such as banking, healthcare and retail the ability to create custom conversational AI apps or deploy pre-built, \u201cdomain-trained\u201d chatbots.\n\u201cKore.ai\u2019s platform encompasses intelligent virtual agent, contact center AI, agent AI and search and answer capabilities for all kinds of customer experience and employee experience use cases,\u201d Koneru said. \u201cIn addition, Kore.ai\u2019s array of industry and horizontal solutions address the needs of specific industries and enterprise functions.\u201d\nBut aren\u2019t there lots of vendors building GenAI- and LLM-powered solutions for search, question-answering and the other sorts of applications Kore.ai advertises support? Indeed, there are.\nSee Acree, which hosts a platform for building corporate GenAI apps, and Giga ML, which offers tools to help companies deploy LLMs offline. Reka and Contextual AI both recently emerged from stealth to help create custom AI models for organizations, while Fixie is crafting tools to make it easier for companies to code on top of LLMs.\nWhat Kore.ai does differently, Koneru asserts, is offer great flexibility where it concerns where companies can deploy their AI apps \u2014 in the cloud, locally or in virtual machines \u2014 and the degree to which they can fine-tune these apps. For certain applications (e.g. text summarization, finding and generating answers, topic discovery and sentiment analysis), Koneru makes the case that fine-tuned models \u2014 Kore.ai\u2019s specialty \u2014 are superior to the larger, more powerful models available from vendors like Anthropic and OpenAI, as well as more cost-effective.\nThere\u2019s a privacy argument to be made, too, for smaller, offline models.\nA 2023 Predibase survey found that more than 75% of enterprises don\u2019t plan on using commercial, cloud-hosted LLMs in production over fears that the models will compromise sensitive info. In a separate poll from GenAI platform Portal26 and data research firm CensusWide, 85% of businesses said that they\u2019re concerned about GenAI\u2019s privacy and security risks.\nCreating a GenAI or conversational AI workflow using Kore.ai\u2019s web tooling. Image Credits: Kore.ai\n\u201cOver the past 18 months, we\u2019ve observed that fine-tuned models are very effective compared to pre-trained models for specific enterprise use cases,\u201d Koneru said. \u201cCompared to a large pre-trained model, it takes less than 2% of the enterprise data to train and create a fine-tuned model that companies can deploy safely for enterprise use cases. We\u2019ve successfully built smaller enterprise LLMs that provide higher efficiency, better accuracy, the ability to control responses and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 reduce latency and cost.\u201d\nAlso unlike some rivals, Kore.ai offers ways for organizations to scale up their AI as needed, Koneru says, and expand their use of AI into new and diverse domains.\n\u201cKore.ai sits above the infrastructure and fragmentation of all the LLM layers with a platform-driven approach, offering freedom of choice with built-in guardrails for effective AI implementation,\u201d Koneru added.\nNow, the extent to which these capabilities are truly differentiating is subject to debate. Vendors like Google Cloud, Azure and AWS offer robust scaling solutions for conversational AI and GenAI apps, and Kore.ai isn\u2019t the only platform to let customers deploy models in a range of local and cloud compute environments.\nBut \u2014 whether on the strength of its platform, nearly 1,000-person-workforce, marketing campaign or all three \u2014 Orlando, Florida-based Kore.ai has established an impressive foothold in the competitive AI field. The company\u2019s customer base eclipsed 400 brands (including PNC, AT&T, Cigna, Coca-Cola, Airbus and Roche) last year, and its annual recurring revenue now stands north of $100 million \u2014 thanks to income from licensing and usage fees in addition to consulting services.\nIt probably helps that funding for GenAI startups of all stripes remains strong. According to a recent survey from GlobalData, the London-based data analytics and consulting firm, GenAI startups raised a record $10 billion in 2023 \u2014 a 110% increase compared to 2021.\nThe question is whether the growth is sustainable, given that GenAI isn\u2019t a home run in the enterprise \u2014 at least not yet. Koneru argues that it is, pointing to surveys like Gartner\u2019s from last October, which found that 55% of organizations are already piloting or deploying GenAI tech into production for functions such as customer service, marketing and sales.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t observed any slowdown in the market,\u201d Koneru said. \u201cThe most pressing challenge [we\u2019re facing] is to operate and innovate in a market that\u2019s not just seen rapid growth but also disruption driven by advancements in technology, changing user expectations and a broader integration of newer AI capabilities that are evolving each day. Enterprise players need to take advantage of the benefits of technology while avoiding security, privacy and compliance pitfalls.\u201d\nAdded FTV Capital\u2019s Kapil Venkatachalam in a statement: \u201cWhile the advanced AI market has experienced rapid growth in recent years, many enterprises are grappling with how to responsibly and effectively deploy AI across their organizations. We were impressed with Kore.ai\u2019s open platform approach for leveraging AI models, scalability, vertical specific out-of-the-box applications and low-code no-code capabilities, making them well-positioned to take advantage of the growing demand from global brands looking for innovative AI solutions to enhance business interactions and drive value.\u201d\n",

      "title": "Semron wants to replace chip transistors with \u2018memcapacitors\u2019",
      "content": "\nA new Germany-based startup, Semron, is developing what it describes as \u201c3D-scaled\u201d chips to run AI models locally on smartphones, earbuds, VR headsets and other mobile devices.\nCo-created by Kai-Uwe Demasius and Aron Kirschen, engineering graduates from the Dresden University of Technology, Semron\u2019s chips use electrical fields to perform calculations instead of electrical currents \u2014 the medium of conventional processors. This enables the chips to achieve higher energy efficiency while keeping the fabrication costs to produce them down, Kirschen claims.\n\u201cDue to an expected shortage in AI compute resources, many companies with a business model that [relies] on access to such capabilities risk their existence \u2014 for example, large startups that train their own models,\u201d Kirschen told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cThe unique features of our technology will enable us to hit the price point of today\u2019s chips for consumer electronics devices even though our chips are capable of running advanced AI, which others are not.\u201d\nSemron\u2019s chips \u2014 for which Demasius and Kirschen filed an initial patent in 2016, four years before they founded Semron \u2014 tap a somewhat unusual component known as a \u201cmemcapacitor,\u201d or a capacitor with memory, to run computations. The majority of computer chips are made of transistors, which unlike capacitors can\u2019t store energy; they merely act like \u201con/off\u201d switches, either letting an electric current through or stopping it.\nSemron\u2019s memcapacitors, made out of conventional semiconductor materials, work by exploiting a principle known in chemistry as charge shielding. The memcapacitors control an electric field between a top electrode and bottom electrode via a \u201cshielding layer.\u201d The shielding layer, in turn, is controlled by the chip\u2019s memory, which can store the different \u201cweights\u201d of an AI model. (Weights essentially act like knobs in a model, manipulating and fine-tuning its performance as it trains on and processes data.)\nThe electric field approach minimizes the movement of electrons at the chip level, reducing energy usage \u2014 and heat. Semron aims to leverage the heat-reducing properties of the electric field to place potentially hundreds of layers of memcapacitors on a single chip \u2014 greatly increasing compute capacity.\nA schematic showing Semron\u2019s 3D AI chip design. Image Credits: Semron\n\u201cWe use this property as an enabler to deploy several hundred times the compute resources on a fixed silicon area,\u201d Kirschen added. \u201cThink of it like hundreds of chips in one package.\u201d\nIn a 2021 study published in the journal Nature Electronics, researchers at Semron and the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics successfully trained a computer vision model at energy efficiencies of over 3,500 TOPS/W \u2014 35 to 300 times higher than existing techniques. TOPS/W is a bit of a vague metric, but the takeaway is that memcapacitors can lead to dramatic energy consumption reductions while training AI models.\nNow, it\u2019s early days for Semron, which Kirschen says is in the \u201cpre-product\u201d stage and has \u201cnegligible\u201d revenue to show for it. Often the toughest part of ramping up a chip startup is mass manufacturing and attaining a meaningful customer base \u2014 albeit not necessarily in that order.\nMaking matters more difficult for Semron is the fact that it has stiff competition in custom chip ventures like Kneron, EnCharge\u00a0and Tenstorrent, which have collectively raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital. EnCharge, like Semron, is designing computer chips that use capacitors rather than transistors, but using a different substrate architecture.\nSemron, however \u2014 which has an 11-person workforce that it\u2019s planning to grow by around 25 people by the end of the year \u2014 has managed to attract funding from investors, including Join Capital, SquareOne, OTB Ventures and Onsight Ventures. To date, the startup has raised 10 million euro (~$10.81 million).\nSaid SquareOne partner Georg Stockinger via email:\n\u201cComputing resources will become the \u2018oil\u2019 of the 21st century. With infrastructure-hungry large language models conquering the world and Moore\u2019s law reaching the limits of physics, a massive bottleneck in computing resources will shape the years to come. Insufficient access to computing infrastructure will greatly slow down productivity and competitiveness both of companies and entire nation-states. Semron will be a key element in solving this problem by providing a revolutionary new chip that is inherently specialized on computing AI models. It breaks with the traditional transistor-based computing paradigm and reduces costs and energy consumption for a given computing task by at least 20x.\u201d\n",

      "content": "\nGoogle CEO Sudar Pichai said that the company\u2019s Google One cloud storage service is \u201d just about to cross\u201d 100 million subscribers.\nSpeaking during Alphabet\u2019s Q4 2023 earning call, Pichai added that the company is looking to add more AI-powered features to the Google One service. The search giant first launched Google One in 2018. Since then the product has evolved and has extra perks including Google Photos editing features such as magic eraser, portrait light and portrait blur, color pop, and sky suggestion.\nGoogle One Plans start from $1.99 per month, which gives you 100GB of storage shareable with five people and access to its VPN service in the U.S.\nPichai noted that Google\u2019s overall subscription business \u2014 including YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV, and Google One \u2014 is on an upward trajectory and has crossed $15 billion in annual revenues. The company said that this is a 5x jump as compared to 2019. It also added that because of the strong subscription performance, the \u201cSubscriptions, Platforms and Devices\u201d vertical has registered a 23% growth year-on-year.\nGoogle last mentioned that YouTube\u2019s paid plans had 80 million in November 2022. But there hasn\u2019t been another update since then. The company mentioned that YouTube Shorts are watched by 2 billion signed-in users every month and 7 billion daily plays \u2014 the same numbers as noted in Google\u2019s Q3 2023 results.\nEarlier this month, Google laid off nearly 1,000 employees in divisions including hardware, engineering, and services and 100 employees from YouTube. Later, Pichai sent an internal memo to the staff saying there will be more job cuts this year.\nNotably, in its earnings release, Google mentioned that it had 182,502 employees, slightly more than the 182,381 employees it reported in the Q3 earnings release. However, the number is significantly lower than the 190,234 employees it had at the end of 2022.\nGoogle\u2019s $65.5 billion ad revenue fell short of analyst expectations of $65.8 billion despite a year-on-year increase of 11%. The company\u2019s stocks dipped by 4% because of this miss.\n",

      "content": "\nThe Iconfactory, the maker of a popular third-party Twitter client, Twitterrific, that was among those killed off by Twitter under Elon Musk\u2019s management, is hoping to recover from its losses with a new app that combines your social media, news feeds and alerts into one experience. The app, dubbed \u201cProject Tapestry\u201d as it launches on Kickstarter, will support Twitter/X alternatives like Bluesky, Mastodon and Tumblr, and possibly Instagram Threads when its developer API becomes available. However, it won\u2019t support X itself due to the company\u2019s ban on third-party apps.\nA working prototype of Project Tapestry has already been developed and if The Iconfactory is able to raise $100,000 in funding through Kickstarter it will further develop the app to be launched to the public.\nAs described, Project Tapestry is meant to organize today\u2019s fragmented online media into one interface, by allowing users to follow a variety of sources in one place. For instance, you could track your favorite blogs, news sites, social networks and webcomics, as well as critical updates that used to come via Twitter, like weather alerts or earthquake warnings.\nThis would involve working with any site that offers an RSS feed, which most blogs and news sites (without a paywall) already do. It would also integrate with the startups that are offering Twitter alternatives, like Bluesky, powered by the new AT Protocol, and Mastodon, which will be powered by another emerging web standard, ActivityPub. (The company isn\u2019t planning on Threads support at launch, but would consider adding it, as well, if an API was made available, we\u2019re told.)\nOther planned sources include Tumblr, Micro.blog, USGS Earthquakes, NOAA Satellite and GO Comics. Facebook and Instagram will not be available, though.\nAfter setup, Tapestry would organize all your updates into one feed, displayed in chronological order. Plus, the app could remove duplicates to cut down on the clutter \u2014 like when someone posts a link to multiple social networks at once. In the new app, those mentions could be combined, so you only see the post one time.\nImage Credits: The Iconfactory\nThe team envisions making Project Tapestry\u2019s timeline something that anyone could integrate with by writing plug-ins using JavaScript that will translate between the web and the native iOS app. For example, developers tinkering around with Raspberry Pi could send custom alerts to their timeline via this interface.\nOther notable features include the ability to mark items as read, remember your reading position in the timeline, support for light and dark themes, and a couple more copied over from the company\u2019s Twitterrific days \u2014 like muting and \u201cmuffling.\u201d The latter was a popular option for those who wanted to know what was being said by minimizing the tweets, and providing a short description of what was hidden instead.\nIf the company\u2019s stretch goal of $150,000 is reached on Kickstarter, the team will also work on a more advanced search feature that would allow you to search across the sources and social networking posts you already follow instead of the wider web. That aspect sounds particularly promising at a time when Google Search\u2019s quality is diminishing due to SEO spam and AI-written pages.\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Iconfactory has turned to Kickstarter. It also used the site to fund the development of Twitterrific for Mac in 2017, which was funded in 20 days.\nThough Iconfactory today makes several apps for creativity, entertainment and gaming, the shutdown of Twitterrific had been difficult for the company and its team.\nLaments The Iconfactory\u2019s Principal/Designer Gedeon Maheux, the new project came about because the team \u201chad invested so much time and energy into Twitter,\u201d but then Twitter \u201cwall[ed] up their garden and people like us were forced to leave,\u201d he says. \u201cNow you have friends that are on different services, different places, and it\u2019s hard to keep track of them.\u201d\nThe need for crowdsourced funds was also necessary because of the loss of Twitterrific.\n\u201cThe death of Twitterrific really hurt\u2026Killing third-party Twitter apps really put a dent in [our revenue] because Twitterrific was one of our bread-and-butter apps. It really fueled development and allowed us to do these things that we loved,\u201d notes Maheux. Since Twitterrific\u2019s shutdown, he says, the comapny has not yet been able to \u201cclose the gap.\u201d\n\u201cHopefully, Tapestry will help with that,\u201d he adds.\nTwitterrific may not be a household name like Twitter once was, but the app had a sizable influence on Twitter culture.\nThe Twitter client was one of the earliest on the market and began using a bird logo, which other clients then adopted, too. Later, Twitter started using a bird as its official logo in 2010. The Iconfactory also contributed the word \u201ctweet\u201d to the vocabulary around using Twitter, and created a workaround for Twitter\u2019s lack of an \u201cEdit\u201d button in 2014 by creating a feature that would delete and repost a tweet, giving the appearance of edits.\nWith its understanding of how to tap into the market of social apps, Tapestry has the potential to now solve new pain points for users who are leaving Twitter/X \u2014 a way to track the news, people and information that matter to them, no matter where they go.\nThe $100,000 Kickstarter goal will allow The Iconfactory to get the initial app done and made public via the App Store. Since launching the crowdsourced funding plea this morning, they\u2019ve raised over $46,000.\nThe company has historically been averse to the idea of taking venture capital, as it wants to remain independent, but if Tapestry takes off after going public, Maheux admits it\u2019s \u201cnever say never\u201d when it comes to raising outside funds. In the meantime, however, if you want to use an app like Tapestry, you\u2019ll have to donate toward its creation.\n",

      "title": "Some IRS employees still access TikTok despite ban on government devices",
      "content": "\nThe TikTok ban on U.S. government devices is proving hard to enforce. A month after the IRS was found to be in non-compliance with the federally mandated ban on the Beijing-based video app, two Republican senators are asking the IRS why it\u2019s still allowing some of the agency\u2019s employees to access the social network, and what that means for the security of Americans\u2019 IRS data.\nThe letter, announced today, was sent to the IRS on Thursday by U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), a member of the Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight, and John Thune (R-SD), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Taxation and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Oversight. In it, they press the IRS to respond to questions about why the ban is not being upheld, suggesting that the confidential nature of taxpayer data could be compromised by TikTok\u2019s data collection practices.\nIn fact, The Wall Street Journal reported today that TikTok employees still sometimes shared data with their China-based parent company ByteDance, despite the operation code-named \u201cProject Texas\u201d that TikTok implemented to keep U.S. user data on Oracle servers in the states. That initiative had been designed to convince the U.S. government that U.S. user data was safe. The WSJ found that, instead, managers would sometimes instruct employees at TikTok to share data with others through unofficial channels, including private data, like a user\u2019s email, birth date or IP address.\nThe timing of the report around IRS use of TikTok may raise concern among lawmakers that TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data isn\u2019t as protected as once hoped. It also demonstrates how unenforceable such bans could be amid the U.S. government\u2019s bureaucracy and red tape, offering a preview of what it could be like to enforce such a ban at the federal level for all Americans \u2014 a move that some politicians from both parties believe should take place.\nAs for the IRS, a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) last month found that the IRS\u2019 Criminal Investigation unit\u2019s staff were still able to access TikTok on both their computers and mobile devices, long after The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued its \u201cNo TikTok on Government Devices\u201d guidance in February 2023. The IRS hadn\u2019t asked for the Criminal Investigation division to be exempt from the ban through official channels, nor had it cut off employees\u2019 TikTok access, the report said.\nThe IRS countered it didn\u2019t need an exception because the TikTok app was only used via third-party software \u2014 in other words, their devices weren\u2019t directly connecting with TikTok. It also pushed back at the idea that the Criminal Investigation division chief should come up with a plan to fully cut off employee access to the app, saying it would use its own internal process to determine exceptions. In total, 2,800 mobile devices in the division were found to be able to access TikTok, TIGTA said.\nIn other areas, the IRS largely complied with the ban. When TIGTA found that TikTok was accessible on 23 phones used by employees in the Communications and Liaison group, which monitors social media, they were cut off from the app. The agency also said that it would update its \u201cBring Your Own Device\u201d (BYOD) policy guidance to align with the ban by October 2024.\nIn the senators\u2019 letter to TikTok, they pressed the IRS on its delay for implementing the ban within its BYOD program and the exception made for Criminal Investigation staff, writing, \u201cNot only has the IRS failed to comply with the law, but its lack of action with regard to implementation of the No TikTok on Government Devices Act has potentially compromised confidential taxpayer information located on devices that have TikTok, which has close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and alarming data practices.\u201d\nThe letter asks the IRS to respond to a series of questions by February 8, 2024. These include questions about how many IRS employees use their own devices, how many of those access TikTok with the same devices they use for IRS-related functions and what security protocols IRS employees must follow to protect taxpayer data, among other things. The senators also want to know if the IRS has removed TikTok from the Criminal Investigation mobile devices, and why they needed it in the first place.\nTikTok has been asked for comment, but one was not provided by the time of publication.\nThe IRS is only one facet of the wider U.S. TikTok ban on government devices, which last February gave government agencies 30 days to ensure they no longer had the app on their employees\u2019 phones and computers. The order had followed similar bans from dozens of U.S. states and others from outside the U.S., including the EU, Canada, India and more. However, many bans are being challenged in the courts. For instance, Montana\u2019s ban on TikTok is now on hold, a federal judge ruled last month.\nLetter to Daniel Werfel Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service by TechCrunch on Scribd\n\n",

TikTok confirmed that the feature is currently in limited testing, but did not provide any further details.\nThe new test feature automatically identifies items in videos and directs viewers to \u201cfind similar items on TikTok Shop.\u201d In the past, only approved influencers and brands had the ability to tag products. The new feature would bring e-commerce links into more videos on the app.\nThe news comes as Bloomberg reported earlier this month that TikTok is looking to grow the size of its TikTok Shop U.S. business tenfold to as much as $17.5 billion this year. With this goal, TikTok would not only be looking to take on Amazon, but also fellow Chinese-owned companies Temu and Shein, both of which have become popular in the U.S. But, TikTok has something these other companies don\u2019t, which is an extremely popular social media network that has the potential to reach millions of buyers.\nDuring the Black Friday and Cyber Monday season in November, more than 5 million new U.S. customers purchased something via TikTok Shop. For context, the social media app currently has around 150 million users in the U.S.\nTikTok Shop, which officially\u00a0launched in the U.S. in September 2023, lets creators tag products to allow users to buy products from in-feed videos and live videos. The new feature would bring TikTok Shop links to regular content on the app, which\u00a0may not be a welcome change for some.\nNew data reveals that TikTok\u2019s growth has started to slow, raising the question of whether the app\u2019s TikTok Shop e-commerce efforts could be to blame. In 2022, TikTok\u2019s monthly active users grew an average of 12% year-over-year per quarter, but this figure fell to 3% year-over-year per quarter in 2023.

      "title": "Reading the fine print of Apple\u2019s DMA rules: 25 things app developers need to know",
      "content": "\nApple last week announced new rules for EU app developers to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). After being designated as a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d the EU required Apple to make changes to increase competition in the app industry, including by offering new ways to download apps from outside the App Store, new frameworks and API, a revised commission and fee structure, and more. Developer responses to the changes have been mixed, as several larger companies, including Epic Games, Spotify and more recently Microsoft, have come out against Apple\u2019s changes, which seemed designed to ensure that Apple\u2019s ability to profit from iPhone apps continues, regardless of how they\u2019re discovered and installed.\nWhile developers are being presented with a reduced commission in the EU \u2014 either 17% for digital transactions and services or 10% for those who qualify for a small business discount (or subscriptions in year two), the company will continue to charge an additional 3% if the company uses Apple\u2019s payment processing service.\nIn addition, under the new terms, the company is implementing a Core Technology Fee that Apple says pays for their access to Apple\u2019s proprietary technologies and tools, developer services and support, and platform integrity. This fee applies to apps both distributed on the App Store and through alternative marketplaces and is \u20ac0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.\nApple is also introducing more options, like the ability to choose your default web browser and, for developers, the ability to tap into NFC payment technology (which powers Apple Pay) for their own apps.\nAfter digging through the documents Apple provided and speaking to the company, there are a few caveats and details to these rules that developers should know. We\u2019re compiling them below as a starting point and will add to this list over time as we learn more.\n\nApple will permit alternative app marketplaces that compete with its own App Store, but Apple is still controlling which companies will be allowed to build such apps. Apple says that marketplace app developers will need a \u20ac1,000,000 letter of credit from an A-rated financial institution to receive the entitlement. The company says only developers who commit to protecting users will gain access to its new APIs needed to build their marketplace apps, and this is one way Apple is vetting them. It believes this limitation will ensure that malicious actors don\u2019t open marketplaces that harm iPhone users, where they engage in scams.\nApp marketplace apps can only be distributed from developer websites,\u00a0not the App Store.\nIndividual apps (non-marketplace apps) cannot be distributed from a website.\u00a0They have to choose either App Store distribution or alternative distribution through a third-party marketplace.\nMarketplace apps have to pay the Core Technology Fee for each install, while apps distributed through alternative marketplaces or the App Store get their first million installs for free per calendar year.\u00a0This encourages individual developers to update their apps and release security fixes, even if they\u2019re not distributed through the App Store, but applies an upfront cost to developers running an App Store rival. Apple points out that it\u2019s developed more than 600 new APIs as part of its effort to enable marketplaces.\nThe Core Technology fee is waived for nonprofits, government agencies and educational institutions.\nThe Core Technology fee is not waived for free apps, open source apps or freemium apps, which means it would not make sense for a free app developer to even distribute under the EU\u2019s new terms because if their app goes over a million installs per year, they\u2019d have to pay Apple anyway. Apple thinks that these apps will still be able to pay the Core Technology Fee because they likely monetize in another way, like via advertising or physical goods. (In other words, Apple found a way to tap into revenues apps make outside of in-app purchases and paid downloads!) Apple estimates the Core Technology Fee will only be paid by less than 1% of developers in the EU. However, developers don\u2019t have to adopt it \u2014 it only applies to those who adopt the new terms for alternative distribution and payment processing.\u00a0\nApple will protect against \u201cinstall bombing\u201d \u2014 that is, a bad actor increasing the app install numbers of a competitor, for instance by downloading their app on multiple devices. Apple says it will offer an install verification mechanism to ensure all installs are from real Apple devices and will limit the number of first annual installs that can come from a single device. It may also terminate developer accounts that engage in suspicious behavior if warranted.\u00a0\nA user can install multiple third-party app marketplaces on their device, but the marketplace will need to request permission from the user before they can start installing apps from those rival app stores.\nUsers will gain new settings and controls to manage the new ways apps are installed. This includes being able to see the source of where an app was installed (e.g. which third-party app store). A permission in Settings dubbed \u201cAllow Marketplace from Developer\u201d will let users pick those alternative app stores they want to permit. Users can also revoke a developer\u2019s permissions if need be, and manage their default app marketplace in the settings.\n\u00a0Regardless of how an app is distributed, apps will be \u201cnotarized.\u201d This process means the app gets an installation key which is used to install the app on the user\u2019s device. Apple will also scan apps for viruses, malware and other security threats as part of this process. It will additionally ensure that certain things about the app are true, using human review \u2014 for instance, that it does what it claims to do.\n\u00a0Notarization does not include the quality standards for app store review or allow Apple to reject apps based on their content. That means illicit content and pornography, then, could be permitted.\n\u00a0If Apple detects an app from a third-party app store contains malware after it\u2019s installed, it will prevent it from launching. Whether Apple will be able to reliably detect malware when an app is installed outside the App Store remains to be seen. Apple won\u2019t be responsible for things like refunds or the risk of fraud and abuse that could occur outside its App Store through third-party app marketplaces, however.\n\u00a0Notarization will allow Apple to show users more details about an app before they install it, including the name, developer\u2019s description with screenshots and age rating.\u00a0\n\u00a0Apple is heading off attempts by developers to create alternative game stores by offering the new ability for game stores that stream titles to exist on its App Store.\u00a0Before, each game had to be a separate app.\n\u00a0Developers have to submit a single binary for their app,\u00a0regardless of whether it\u2019s distributed across the App Store or an alternative app marketplace. This means apps can only be installed from one app store at a time,\u00a0so if users had downloaded the App Store version, they\u2019d have to delete it to download a new non-App Store version.\n\u00a0While developers can choose to offer alternative payment processors in their App Store apps, they can\u2019t offer that alongside Apple\u2019s own in-app payments (IAP). But they can switch back to IAP at any time.\n\u00a0Users will be prompted to choose a default browser app when they open Safari for the first time on their device after updating to iOS 17.4 and they\u2019ll be able to manage their default app browser in iOS settings.\n\u00a0Browser app developers will be able to choose alternative engines other than Safari\u2019s WebKit in the EU. Apple says it\u2019s bringing technologies from WebKit to iOS to enable \u201chigh-performance\u201d alternative browsers. This includes just in time compilation, multi-process support, a custom web sandbox and Passkeys.\n\u00a0Browser app developers will be required to adhere to industry standard privacy and security practices,\u00a0like addressing security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.\n\u00a0Developers will be able to offer NFC payments within their apps without using Apple Pay or Apple\u2019s Wallet app. This software solution is similar to how Android today supports NFC payments for alternative wallets and enables apps to access \u201cfield detect,\u201d which invokes the user\u2019s default NFC app when an iPhone is placed near an NFC terminal.\n\u00a0Developers will be able to integrate third-party payments either directly in their app or inform developers of the offers and promotions available when purchasing on their website.\n\u00a0While developers could get started with the beta release of Xcode 15.3 and iOS 17.4 last week, the changes won\u2019t become available to Apple users in the EU until March.\u00a0\n\u00a050 new reports in App Store Connect will include metrics around engagement (like number of users interacting with an app on the App Store or sharing it with others); commerce (downloads, sales, proceeds, preorders, transactions made with Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system; app usage (crashes, active devices, installs, app deletions, etc.); and frameworks usage (the app\u2019s interaction with OS process, like PhotoPicker, Widgets and CarPlay).\n\u00a0Developers will be allowed to share their app store with alternative app marketplace developers and third parties, including by exporting the full history of their app\u2019s engagement, commerce and usage. More details about this will come in March.\n\u00a0Developers can choose between the existing terms available today (e.g. commission structure) or the new terms.\u00a0However, those who adopt Apple\u2019s new EU business terms at any time will never be able to switch back to Apple\u2019s existing business terms for their EU apps.\n\n\nApple\u2019s answer to EU\u2019s gatekeeper rules is new \u2018core tech\u2019 fee for apps\n\n",

However, those who adopt Apple's new EU business terms at any time will never be able to switch back to Apple's existing business terms for their EU apps.\n\n- Apple will permit alternative app marketplaces that compete with its own App Store, but Apple is still controlling which companies will be allowed to build such apps.\n\n- Apple is introducing a Core Technology Fee that applies to apps both distributed on the App Store and through alternative marketplaces and is \u20ac0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.\n\n- Apple is also introducing more options, like the ability to choose your default web browser and, for developers, the ability to tap into NFC payment technology (which powers Apple Pay) for their own apps.",

      "content": "\nInstagram Threads is gaining traction after growth stalled last year, which had some prematurely wondering if the app was already dead. New data indicates that\u2019s not the case \u2014 in fact, Threads is continuing to grow, having tripled its downloads month-over-month in December, which gave it a place in the top 10 most downloaded apps for the month across both the App Store and Google Play.\nAccording to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures, Threads saw 12 million new downloads in December 2023, earning it a No. 4 spot in the Top Charts by downloads on Apple\u2019s App Store. It also saw 16 million downloads on Google Play, which gave it the No. 8 spot. On both stores combined, it was the No. 6 app by way of new installs. Not dead yet, in other words.\nImage Credits: Appfigures\nThreads famously had a record-breaking launch, reaching 100 million registered users within its first five days. However, the app saw its daily downloads decline starting last September through the end of the year. But in December, Threads once again returned to growth, likely due to the push Meta had given the app by displaying ads on Facebook that featured Threads\u2019 viral posts. Today, there are an estimated 160 million Threads users, according to one tracker. Active users have likely grown as well from Meta\u2019s last update on the app during its October earnings when the company said Threads had less than 100 million monthly active users. (Meta reports its next earnings on February 1.)\nThe app could also be benefiting from its move into the \u201cfediverse\u201d \u2014 the social network comprised of interconnected servers that communicate via the ActivityPub protocol, like Mastodon. Though Threads is moving slowly to integrate with ActivityPub, knowing that it will soon be a place where users can engage with another sizable community \u2014 and one where many former Twitter users have since landed \u2014 could have aided in Threads\u2019 reputation and adoption.\nIn addition, Threads recently announced the launch of an endpoint, allowing developers of third-party apps and websites to use a dynamic URL to refill text into the Threads composer. For example, there\u2019s now a website where anyone can generate Threads share links and profile badges. Marketing tool provider Shareaholic also just launched Threads Share buttons for websites, including both desktop and mobile sites.\nThis flurry of activity around Threads is helping to move the app up in the chart rankings, though some inorganic boosts from Meta itself are likely also responsible for the jump in downloads, given the size.\nThough Threads was in the top 10 apps by downloads last month, it didn\u2019t quite break into the top 5\u2026but its parent company did.\nInstagram became the No. 1 most downloaded app in December with a combined 54 million installs from the App Store and Google Play, overtaking TikTok for first place. That could be an early indication that people are starting to get fed up with TikTok\u2019s push into e-commerce, which has turned the video app into an influencer-powered QVC. TikTok is still a massively popular app but its growth has started to slow amid consumer complaints that TikTok Shop is ruining the app\u2019s experience.\nInstagram\u2019s TikTok competitor, Reels, could be now benefiting from the backlash, it seems.\nAs for Threads\u2019 direct rival, X, the company previously known as Twitter is still feeling the impacts of its rebranding \u2014 even though X added \u201cformerly Twitter\u201d to its App Store listing in September to rank at the top of search results for its older name.\nIn December, the app had only an estimated 8.5 million installs, Appfigures told TechCrunch. That made it the No. 29 app by downloads on the App Store and No. 46 on Google Play. That\u2019s well behind other top social networking apps and even productivity apps like Zoom, the data indicates.\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\u00a0\n",

Last year, the company rolled out the ability for users to post 12-second video reviews. In the coming months, the revamped feed will also feature these videos.\nAdditionally, Yelp is rolling out a new search experience for the iOS app, which will show popular searches, recent searches, and recently viewed businesses even before you type in a query.\nImage Credits: Yelp\nSimilar to the home feed, the search results will include an image-forward experience that will show relevant images from the listings. Plus, for better discoverability, Yelp will feature \u201cPeople also search for\u201d and \u201cPopular dishes nearby\u201d (through photos posted by reviewers) carousels.\nImage Credits: Yelp\nLast year, Yelp started to highlight relevant reviews through AI with an update. The company said it has improved that feature on the back end with the ability to match more queries. Additionally, Yelp now uses AI to show a summary of a business when you open its page. This is based on recent reviews posted by users.\nImage Credits: Yelp\nYelp is also rolling out review-related updates, such as badges for reviews, and more interactive review topic categories to help users get started with a review. The platform will start showing the badges next to a user\u2019s review in the next few months to establish that a person is likely passionate about this category.\nImage Credits: Yelp\nUpdates to services experience\nYelp is trying to connect users to better service professionals by asking users questions about the issue beforehand through a form. The form has questions such as the category of services, what you need to repair, and what the issue is.\nImage Credits: Yelp\nPlus, the company allows you to send photos and videos to service professionals so that you don\u2019t have to describe what you need just through text.\nYelp said previously when it shared your number with service companies, they tended to call even after the project was complete. To maintain user privacy, the company now uses a temporary masked number \u2014 through a partnership with Twilio \u2014 to connect you to businesses. The platform also gives you the ability to directly text businesses instead of having to open the app each time you want to chat with them.\nImage Credits: Yelp\nLast year, the company announced the \u201cYelp Guaranteed\u201d program that offered users up to $2,500 in a money-back guarantee if a project goes wrong. Yelp said the protection is now available across the U.S.\nWith the winter release, Yelp also rolled out the ability to send quick replies to businesses and archive projects. For businesses, it is introducing a revamped home page, a better onboarding experience with new budget recommendations for ad-sends, and a way to schedule consultations with Yelp advertising representatives.\nYelp, which is announcing its new earnings on February 8, posted a net revenue of $345 million for Q3 2023. At that time, the company also slightly raised its annual revenue outlook for 2023 from $1.332 billion to $1.337 billion.\n",

As part of the acquisition, the app\u2019s founder Ricardo Clerigo is also joining ClickUp as Head of Calendar.\nU.K.-based Hypercal was founded in 2022 as an app for Mac and offered integration with different apps such as Notion, OneNote, Apple Notes, Google Docs, Todolist, Apple Reminders, Asana, Things app, Microsoft To-Do, and Slack.\nIts free plan allowed users to connect with one calendar and one task app. Hypercal also had a paid tier costing $10 per month for unlimited calendar and task integrations.\nImage Credits: Hypercal\nClickUp offers a single platform for companies to chat, collaborate on documents, manage projects, track timelines, ideate on whiteboards, and get insights from analytical dashboards.\nZeb Evans, CEO and founder of ClickUp, confirmed the acquisition to TechCrunch in a statement and said that Hypercal will help infuse new AI-powered features into the company\u2019s productivity suite.\n\u201cIt has always been ClickUp\u2019s goal to create one app to replace them all. We\u2019ve already eliminated the need for many apps by building docs, whiteboards, dashboards, tasks, and AI natively into our platform. Calendar has been a part of ClickUp\u2019s product for the last 5 years and our future vision is to connect Calendar to \u2018productivity,\u2019 by evolving the core feature,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThrough our acquisition of HyperCal, we will be able to accelerate our vision for individual productivity, which is largely reliant on how workers schedule their day within a calendar. It will provide users with the context they need for every meeting they join, pulling from tasks, docs, and projects.\u201d\nLast July, ClickUp laid off 10% of its staff (around 90 employees) as part of a restructuring to become more efficient and IPO-ready. In 2022, the startup cut 7% of its workforce. At that time, it said this was a \u201cone-time decision\u201d to achieve profitability.\nClickUp last raised $400 million in Series C funding co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global. The company has other investors, including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, Craft Ventures, and Georgian Partners.\nThe calendar apps space has been busy in the last few months. Last November, Vimcal secured $4.5 million in funding from Altos Ventures to expand its enterprise offering. Earlier this month, Notion launched its stand-alone calendar, based on Cron, which it acquired in 2022. At the same time, France-based startup Amie removed its waitlist and integrated email functionality.\n",

      "title": "Heart failure monitoring startup Acorai turns heads with oversubscribed seed",
      "content": "\nSwedish medical device startup Acorai is pairing proprietary sensing hardware and machine learning software with the goal of putting a non-invasive heart pressure monitoring tool in the hands of clinicians \u2014 starting with doctors in the U.S.\nPatients hospitalized with heart failure typically need to undergo an invasive procedure, such as catheterization or having an implant, in order for their medical team to gain information on the pressures inside the chambers of their heart to support their care and treatment. Acorai\u2019s novel Heart Monitor device offers the promise of a far more accessible way for qualified medical professionals to get this kind of reading \u2014 directly through the patient\u2019s skin.\nThe 2019-founded startup has patented a multipronged sensing system that\u2019s able to pick up different signals through the patient\u2019s chest \u2014 vibrations, sounds, a visual read of blood flow and the heart\u2019s electrical activity \u2014 in order to estimate intracardiac pressure without the patient having to undergo anything more invasive than having a nurse or clinician pop the sensing hardware on their chest for a few minutes.\u00a0\n\u201cThe original idea was to be a remote monitoring tool for patients,\u201d CEO Filip Peters tells TechCrunch. \u201cFor a patient to take home the tool and do this themselves, in their home, enabling preventive care . . . But then we realized that the in-hospital workflow seems to be completely overlooked and cardiologists and nurses and hospitals were sort of screaming out for a tool that they could use to help manage patients that are already in the hospital. And realized that that was perhaps a a superior value proposition \u2014 at least to start off with. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve focused the company on.\u201d\nThe initial target for the heart monitoring product is suspected or confirmed heart failure patients \u2014 of which he says there are about 60 million worldwide.\n\u201cBy our estimates, only about 10% of [heart failure] patients actually get the invasive procedure,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo I think one of the benefits that we have is that you can follow your patient temporarily \u2014 you can measure two or three times per day and then see the trend of these measurements over time. Which with a one-off catheterization you can\u2019t by definition.\u201d\nInside the handheld unit \u2014 which is roughly the size (and shape) of a smartphone, in a visual nod at the growing consumerization of medical kits \u2014 are seismic sensors that detect tiny vibrations on the surface of the patient\u2019s chest; acoustic sensors (\u201ceffectively our own optimized stethoscopes,\u201d per Peters) that he says listen for \u201cvery specific frequency ranges\u201d; visual sensors that aim to detect blood flow just under the skin; and ECG sensors to measure the electrical activity of the heart.\u00a0\n\u201cWe borrowed heavily from non-medical industries \u2014 in terms of choosing the sensor stack, the technology stack,\u201d he explains. \u201cPrimarily the oil and gas industry \u2014 and kind of engine diagnostics. What we found there is that there\u2019s been a lot of research into non-invasive sensing of fluid and pressure dynamics, using seismic sensors and acoustic sensors. So non-ultrasonic sensors and detecting, effectively, very small vibrations that correlate with pressure and flow.\u201d\nPeters says the system feeds the raw sensor data into proprietary machine learning algorithms Acorai has developed, which are trained to identify patterns and combine signals \u201coptimally\u201d to estimate patients\u2019 intracardiac pressures directly.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no traditional signal processing that creates a waveform for someone to look at. But we\u2019ve found that there\u2019s a lot of signal value in raw [sensor] data,\u201d he suggests. \u201cSo what we present on the screen is a direct estimate of the pressure \u2014 and not, you know, a red/yellow/green risk index or something like that. But a very real and interpretable number that [clinicians] can then bake into the overall assessment of those patients.\u201d\n\u201cWe are able to estimate these pressures directly, as opposed to an AI index of risk or something like that \u2014 and I think that\u2019s a very important competitive differentiator for us,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is what the cardiologists and nurses want to see in terms of the output. Something that doesn\u2019t tell them what to do but that they can bake into the overall assessment of their patients. That\u2019s been a recurring recurring theme for a lot of the market interviews that we\u2019ve done.\u201d\nImage Credits: Acorai\nOn accuracy, he says the data the Heart Monitor presents is \u201cclinically meaningful information\u201d \u2014 summarizing it as \u201csimilar to the implantable sensors on the market.\u201d\n\u201cWhat that means in numbers is we have correlation of above .8 versus that right heart cath[eterization] gold standard,\u201d he also tells us, adding: \u201cGiven that we are non-invasive, we have a bit more leeway to be, perhaps, less accurate \u2014 even though we\u2019re currently meeting those standards.\n\u201cEqually, when we\u2019re looking at specific cut-off points \u2014 so identifying elevated pressures, for example \u2014 we are in the high 80s in terms of percentage accuracy levels. So, overall, really good. That was our pilot study in Sweden \u2014 which was over 300 patients and over 1,000 measurements. And now we\u2019re doing that same study with a second generation of the device in a large global study with 1,500 patients, 14 hospitals in six countries.\u201d\nAsked about risks of bias in AI-powered analysis of sensor data, such as if training datasets do not properly reflect the diversity of the patient population, he says they\u2019ve used a mix of their own proprietary datasets (collected during clinical studies) and other data they were able to access, via healthcare provider partners including in Sweden, London, the U.S. and Canada, to try to ensure the development of robust machine learning algorithms.\nHe also says the decision to include a range of sensors in the hardware was aimed at shrinking bias and accuracy risks, so the device can, for example, adapt outputs to the patient.\u00a0\u201cPart of why we have such a diverse range of sense technologies is for our machine learning models to be able to dynamically adapt to the type of patient that we are looking at,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo if it is a patient with, perhaps, a darker skin pigment, then the visual sensors may be less important in making a final estimate of that patient, for example. So we\u2019ve built in internal controls on bias \u2014 but then also, you know, robustness in terms of how the device records, so adjusting for patient movement, adjusting for loud environments when the patient is recording and things like that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also worth noting Acorai is positioning the handheld product as a clinician-support tool, rather than a diagnostic medical device. So the tool is intended to be always in the hands of a trained medical professional who would, ultimately, be responsible for taking any patient care decisions.\nDespite prototyping and building the product in Europe, Acorai\u2019s go-to-market strategy is initially focused on the U.S., where \u2014 pending regulatory clearance \u2014 it\u2019s hoping to get the handheld to market and into hospitals in the second half of 2025.\nBack in August, it was granted a \u201cBreakthrough Device Designation\u201d by the U.S.\u2019 medical device regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under a new program it\u2019s running. Specifically, the designation was for \u201cthe non-invasive estimation of diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (dPAP), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP); and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) in patients with Stage C Heart Failure who have been referred for hemodynamic monitoring.\u201d\nFor that it provided preliminary data of 281 patients from a 400-patient Swedish pilot study, which its PR claims \u201cdemonstrated a strong correlation to the invasive gold-standard measurements of pulmonary pressure.\u201d\nThe next step will entail Acorai undertaking a larger study so it can submit more data to the FDA to support an application for clearance for clinical use of its tool in the U.S.\nIt\u2019s one of a handful of startups participating in the FDA\u2019s \u201cBreakthrough Device Program,\u201d which is aimed at supporting the development of novel devices to get to market. Peters says this program\u2019s \u201ctailored support\u201d has been extremely helpful \u2014 saying it\u2019s one of the reasons why the team is opting to commercialize their product in the U.S. first, rather than in Europe, where healthcare regulation (and markets) are more fragmented.\nHe also points to recent changes to EU medical device rules that he says have slowed down clearances for novel medical devices as the notified bodies that have to do conformity assessments get up to speed with the 2021 Medical Devices Regulation.\n\u201cWhereas the FDA seems to be going the other direction \u2014 streamlining the process for, particularly, \u2018breakthrough technologies\u2019\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0and making it easier for companies like ours to get to the market,\u201d he suggests.\nThe startup, which eagle-eyed attendees of TechCrunch Disrupt 2022 might recall since it was exhibiting as one of the Startup Battlefield 200, has just closed a $4.5 million+ seed raise.

      "content": "\nDespite record growth in the solar industry last year, software startup Aurora Solar has laid off 20% of its staff of about 500 people, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\nThe company, which provides software to help solar installers manage their sales, project design and installation process, has missed its growth targets for the past year, a source said. Monday\u2019s layoffs follow a smaller layoff of around 20 people in November, they added.\nAurora Solar last raised $200 million in a Series D round that closed in February 2022, less than nine months after raising a $250 million Series C. In total, the company has raised $523 million, according to PitchBook.\n\u201cLike many other companies in the solar industry, we\u2019ve felt the effects of larger macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates and the impact of NEM 3.0 in California,\u201d Aurora Solar told TechCrunch after publication.\nIn California, the largest solar market in the U.S., changes in net metering (known as NEM 3.0) have led to homeowners getting paid about 75% less for power sold back to utilities. While that hasn\u2019t cratered demand for solar among single-family homeowners, it\u2019s possible the new regulations knocked it off its previous trajectory.\nThe net metering changes generated a surge of interest last year, according to Aurora Solar\u2019s data, likely from homeowners hoping to get in before the new rules took effect.\nWith net metering rates slashed, the state has decided to offer richer incentives for solar installations that include batteries. But many door-to-door sales representatives, especially those who work independently, aren\u2019t as well equipped to sell batteries since they require far more details about a home than solar alone.\nTo design and permit a battery system, sales reps have to calculate the household\u2019s daily energy usage, size up the home\u2019s electrical panel and figure out where to put the batteries. Solar, on the other hand, can often be sold by looking at satellite photos of a home\u2019s roof and surrounding trees and buildings, from which software can easily calculate how much power a solar array can produce.\n\nA comprehensive list of 2023 & 2024 tech layoffs\n\nAs a result, smaller installers have been facing pressure under the new regime. While Aurora Solar says its software is used by 90% of the top 100 solar installers, it also has more than 7,000 customers, many of which likely fall in the long tail of the distribution, those that say they\u2019re under the most pressure. In total, the California solar industry was estimated to cut 17,000 jobs last year.\nThis article has been updated with comment from Aurora Solar.\n",

      "title": "Haven Energy lands $7M Series A 9 months after its seed round",
      "content": "\nThe residential solar industry has been a victim of its own success.\nPeople across the country have raced to install solar panels to take advantage of generous net metering rates, where utilities pay people a premium for their power. Meanwhile, big power producers have found themselves forced to shut off at what used to be peak (and profitable) times.\nIn California, the problem was particularly pronounced. When solar started hitting the mainstream, the state\u2019s grid operator began noticing that as more people connected solar panels, the load on the grid would dip midday. Over the past 15 years, the dip has deepened. Since grids work best when the load on them is smooth, regulators began to mull how to pull it back up.\nSo, a little over a year ago, the California Public Utilities Commission changed how much utilities had to pay for power from new installations for single-family homeowners. Last month, it did the same for multifamily and commercial buildings. For existing solar arrays, the new rates would be phased in over 20 years. There was a silver lining, though: an incentive for home or building owners to install batteries alongside solar panels. That way they could make use of their panels\u2019 production at night, too.\nFor new solar installations, adding a battery isn\u2019t trivial, but it isn\u2019t complicated, either. But for people who already have solar panels, adding a battery is more challenging because of the economics. Solar companies install the bulk of residential and small commercial batteries, but a battery installation without solar isn\u2019t big enough for them to be interested.\nWhich is how Haven Energy got started: Two of the company\u2019s founders, both Casper alumni, had tried for years to get batteries for their homes installed. When they couldn\u2019t, they set out to fix the problem via entrepreneurship.\nIn a bit of auspicious timing, Haven Energy launched in April 2023 just as California\u2019s new rules for single-family homes were taking effect. The startup hit the ground running with a $4.2 million seed round to build a B2B2C platform connecting homeowners with contractors to a battery to their existing solar setup.\nNow, nine months later, the company is back with more news: a $7 million Series A and a new emphasis on building a platform for installers, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned. Lerer Hippeau, Giant Ventures, and Raven One Ventures returned, and they were joined by Comcast Ventures, LifeX, TO VC, and Habitat Partners. ",

In particular, BlueLayer wants to help these companies manage their carbon credits at scale.\nWhile the best way to prevent carbon emissions is by decarbonizing supply chains, carbon credits will also play a role in the coming years as a supplement to these decarbonization efforts.\n\u201cWe think that about 70 to 80% of emissions today can be reduced by actions directly within industrial and general goods supply chains. But there are things that we\u2019re going to have to do that are not within the supply chain of companies,\u201d co-founder and COO Vivian Bertseka told me.\nAnd this is where carbon credits come along. This system of carbon offsetting with carbon project developers is sometimes also called beyond value chain mitigation.\nThe startup focuses specifically on that area and recently raised a $5.6 million seed round led by Point Nine. Before that, the company had already raised a pre-seed round from several angel investors and industry experts, bringing BlueLayer\u2019s total amount raised to $10 million.\nBlueLayer acts as the software back end for carbon project developers. It helps those companies when it comes to managing carbon credits as it acts as the single source of truth for inventory and orders with the ability to generate reports, leverage data visualization tools and eventually make decisions that could potentially maximize revenue.\nBlueLayer aims to focus exclusively on project developers. They could be working on various projects, such as reforestation, forest conservation, peatland restoration and more. The startup also picked a traditional SaaS revenue model instead of charging commissions on carbon credit sales.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a broker; we\u2019re not an intermediary. So we don\u2019t take big commissions on sales and that\u2019s because we need to be aligned with one side of the ecosystem, which is the developers,\u201d co-founder and CEO Alexander Argyros told me.\nRight now, they need better tools to manage their existing projects as well as integrations with other stakeholders. BlueLayer can also connect with legacy ERP systems, distribution channels and rating agencies. In the future, they may have other needs when it comes to pre-financing future projects with forward contracts and pre-allocating carbon credits.\nYou might think that there is a limited pool of potential clients, but BlueLayer has already held talks with over 200 carbon project developers.\nHeadquartered in Berlin with teams in London and Athens, BlueLayer was co-founded by Alexander Argyros, who previously co-founded PE investment platform Moonfare;\u00a0Vivian Bertseka, who was a climate investor with Generation Investment Management and a founding partner at Just Climate;\u00a0and Gerardo Bonilla, Moonfare\u2019s former head of product.\n",

      "content": "\n\n\n\n\nAnshu Sharma\nContributor\n\n\n\n\t\tAnshu Sharma is a serial entrepreneur and a former venture partner at Storm Ventures. \t\n\nMore posts by this contributor\n\nToward transitive data privacy and securing the data you don\u2019t share\nThe unbeatable advantage of Apple and Amazon\n\n\n\nClayton Christensen was an amazing observer of business, and his work on disruption is seminal. His book \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d has come to define how we analyze companies that get disrupted by newcomers.\nThe core of his thesis is that companies focus on their current best customers and improve the product for them while a new entrant comes in with a cheaper product that serves the underserved segment with an inferior product that is good enough \u2014 and over time, the inferior product gets better enough to meet the needs of most customers disrupting the incumbent\u2019s core business.\nBut has he been proven wrong in the last 10 years on many major disruptions? For instance:\n\niPhone was more expensive than competitors at launch.\nTesla was more expensive than most cars for early models, by a lot.\nNvidia GPUs are way more expensive than Intel and ARM machines.\nOpenAI or GPT4 is not cheap. While search engines are free for unlimited use, GPT is $20 month.\n\n \n\n\t\t\tIf you build a truly great product, people will happily pay for it. Just check out how well Apple and Tesla have done.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWhat if the bottom-up cheaper product disrupting the market is a phenomenon limited to commoditized old product categories (think tires and clothes)? Although, one could argue even in those categories the real disruption often starts at the highest end \u2014 run flat tires cost more, yoga pants (Lululemon and Alo Yoga) cost more \u2014 not less than the older products they replace in use.\nThe Christensen theory of disruption could be called \u201cinferior disruption theory\u201d \u2014 inferior, cheaper, good enough products that disrupt incumbents over time. While this clearly happens, there\u2019s a more powerful model for disruption.\nImage Credits: Clayton M. Christensen, Michael E. Raynor, and Rory McDonald\nIn his own words:\nDisruptive innovations, on the other hand, are initially considered inferior by most of an incumbent\u2019s customers. Typically, customers are not willing to switch to the new offering merely because it is less expensive. Instead, they wait until its quality rises enough to satisfy them. Once that\u2019s happened, they adopt the new product and happily accept its lower price. (This is how disruption drives prices down in a market.)\nI would like to propose a different disruption model \u2014 one that starts at the exact opposite end: superior product disruption.\nSuperior product disruption\nAn innovator brings a superior product at a higher price to the market and wins over the top 1% consumers of the product, who are willing to pay a premium. As the product gets more popular, the innovator is able to lower prices due to scale efficiency, cost-effective innovations, and riding cost curves such as Moore\u2019s law over time.\nThis week, Apple starts taking orders for its Vision Pro, a product priced at $3,499 \u2014 about 10x higher than the Meta Quest 2 and 3x higher than the most expensive Meta Quest Pro. Is Apple destined to fail, or have they figured out a better strategy?\nImage Credits: Apple\nWe will find out whether Vision Pro is a winning product and whether the superior product disruption works in this case.\nBut over the years, we have already seen several products start out as super-expensive, superior or better products win the high end of the market and slowly take market share as the product prices come down with scale, innovation and commoditization.\nTesla\nYou can now buy a Tesla for $35,000. The first model cost $120,000. As Elon Musk famously laid out in this \u201csecret master plan\u201d document on August 2, 2006:\n\nBuild sports car.\nUse that money to build an affordable car.\nUse that money to build an even more affordable car.\nWhile doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options.\nDon\u2019t tell anyone.\n\nIt\u2019s been 17 years of Tesla doing literally the above. But Tesla is not the only one.\nNvidia\nIt has consistently produced higher end products with higher end specs for what they call the \u201ctech enthusiast.\u201d It continues to this day with their high-end H100 GPUs.\nOver time, they continually keep innovating at the highest end.\nJensen\u2019s insight: Most of the profits are at the high end of the market.\nIt was true for its landmark Riva chip \u2014 building the highest end product, and consequently at the highest price point the market could afford.\nWhere was Clayton Christensen right?\nI believe Christensen got lots of things right in his book \u2014 primarily the tendency of incumbents to cater to the needs of existing customers in existing markets at the price points they are familiar with.\nIf you are selling a product that is no longer as innovative \u2014 think petroleum-powered cars in the 1980s \u2014 you are likely to get disrupted by someone who builds a good enough car at a cheaper price. Over time, the Japanese car manufacturers who started out with inferior products became better and better at manufacturing \u2014 and design \u2014 and now produce some of the best cars in the world at any price point.\nCell phones vs. landline phones\nIn his original book, Clayton lays out a few examples of disruption:\nImage Credits: Christensen\nIt\u2019s not clear to me at all that cellular phones are worse than landlines. I would argue it\u2019s a vastly superior product \u2014 and clearly sold at a much higher price point.\nThe PC was certainly cheaper than the mainframe but mainframes could be shared and PCs could not. In fact, most people mocked PCs for being too expensive.\nIn both cases, it was the novel superior product that won out.\nWhat is the right strategy for winning?\nI think frameworks like Innovator\u2019s Dilemma \u2014 and many other business strategy frameworks like Blue Ocean/Red Ocean that tell you to avoid competitive markets and so on \u2014 are great for learning. If you are a big company CEO or executive, it may help you watch your back so you don\u2019t get disrupted in your core markets.\nBut when it comes to really building a disruptive new business, my advice to founders and product managers is simple:\nBuild a better product.\nSteve Jobs was right \u2014 you have to obsessively care about the product. Jeff Bezos is right \u2014 you have to obsessively care about the customer. And Elon Musk is right \u2014 you have to question everything from first principles.\nIf you do these things and build an amazing product, it may turn out to be a product that is 10x cheaper \u2014 digital photography is effectively free compared to film, electric cars total cost of ownership is much lower \u2014 or it may turn out to be an expensive product for the high end of the market.\nIf you build a truly great product, people will happily pay for it. Just check out how well Apple and Tesla have done.\nIn a few weeks, we will get to test this theory again \u2014 with a high-end product built with few compromises to deliver a new kind of reality.\n ",

The round comes about two years after the company raised $10 million in Series A capital, this one co-led by Rakuten and IDC Ventures. In total, the company has secured $20.5 million in venture-backed capital.\nLeal works with business-to-consumer brands, e-commerce sites and financial institutions across Latin America to enable merchants to create a customer database to then offer cashback and rewards products to loyal shoppers on everyday purchases.\nTo do this, Leal has built integrations with 160 different point-of-sale systems. Most of the POS systems are local, however, Leal worked to integrate with big players in the United States and Europe that aren\u2019t widely used in Latin America due to cost, Martinez told TechCrunch.\nAlso, merchants can track customer behavior and purchasing patterns for customers who traditionally pay with cash, a payment method notoriously known for being difficult to track. They also have access to campaign management tools for targeted communications.\n\nDevolut leverages e-commerce growth in Latin America to develop reverse logistics tool\n\nMartinez started the company in 2016 with Florence Frech, COO. At the time, the company was on \u201can amazing growth journey,\u201d according to Martinez. Then the global pandemic happened.\n\u201cWe lost 85% of our merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were heavily reliant on brick-and-mortar retailers. Lockdowns were some of the strongest ones after Asia, for example, over six months. We almost had to rebuild our business from 2021 onwards because we had no clients.\u201d\nLeal got its groove back. In 2021, the SaaS marketing company launched a new feature for grocery shoppers to scan paper receipts and earn Leal Coins that could be redeemed for goods and services like gasoline or food deliveries via Rappo. A year later, Leal expanded its rewards program throughout Mexico, Colombia and Central America.\nToday, the company works with more than 1,000 brands across 15 industries and in eight countries. Its customer list includes Subway, Verifone and Chevron. Leal has more than 6 million users, up from 1.5 million in 2020, of which 3.5 million active users joined in the last 12 months.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been developing a lot of gamification, so we can service our consumers in different ways,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThere\u2019s an engagement path and smarter conversation tools so you\u2019re not getting transactional messages, but you\u2019re getting more human-like conversations. We\u2019ve also been working on different marketing solutions to engage the consumer so we can be closer to their lifestyle and bring them bigger value.\u201d\n\nBig wins for Latin America, climate tech momentum and Rover\u2019s $2.3B sale\n\nWith the new investment, Leal plans to reach $10 million in annual recurring revenue, focus on additional penetration in Mexico, omnichannel communications and a set of tools that includes smarter data collection and interactions, and automation of benefits to maximize conversions.\nIt will also work on technology development to improve its artificial intelligence models for further personalization of app rewards and benefits. Martinez also wants to leverage generative AI for enhanced chatbot interactions between brands and consumers.\n\u201cTwo of the channels we\u2019re going to strengthen are WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger so we can have other sources on how to communicate with the consumer,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWith AI and GenAI, we can make better predictions with the data. We can increase experimentation and launch hundreds of different campaigns for customers to see what\u2019s sticking with the consumer and then iterate with different AI models. We are also going to work on content creation so our platform is more personalized and automated to require less human intervention and be plug-and-play.\u201d\n\nEmbracing digital commerce may be retailers\u2019 best bet for staying ahead of a fast-moving industry\n\n",

      "content": "\nIt\u2019s been a long time since Salesforce helped change the world of technology by claiming it was going to end software. Its model of selling access to a managed service that was hosted on the cloud (what we generically call software as a service today, or SaaS) didn\u2019t end software, of course, but it did turn the world away from buying software in a box.\nThe trade-offs were simple. Software offered as a service was cheaper upfront but could cost more over time. In return, vendors promised regular updates and you never had an out-of-date version. No matter how you feel about the subscription economy, the shift from buying Microsoft Office in a box to renewing your Microsoft 365 subscription online is now part of our past.\n\nThe Exchange explores startups, markets and money. \nRead it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s model of selling access to its software services on a subscription basis was imperfect. All business models are, but what some folks realized was that while SaaS and its ilk were tidy profit centers for vendors, their costs could wind up misaligned with buyers\u2019 needs. For example, if you pay for more seats than you use, or some of your paid seats only use the service a little bit, you could wind up paying for more software than you really needed.\nEnter usage-based pricing, which involves charging for software based on how much of it was consumed. Just like how SaaS products ate up older software sales models, some folks thought that consumption-based pricing would be the next thing. Indeed, Twilio grew to mammoth size on the back of the model, carving a Salesforce-like path forward for startups. From the \u201cend of software\u201d to \u201cask your developer,\u201d it seemed the future of software pricing was up for grabs, especially during the last venture boom.\nThen the economy turned and tech companies suddenly had to deal with customers looking to lower their bills. Based on our read of SaaS companies\u2019 quarterly reports, it seems that while all software companies had some soul-searching to do mid-2022 onward, consumption-based models were hit the hardest. That\u2019s perhaps why Salesforce\u2019s founder is still its CEO, while Twilio\u2019s isn\u2019t.\n ",

      "content": "\nSaaS needs a new data system. That\u2019s the driving idea behind Nile, a startup that aims to create this data system with serverless Postgres at its core. Co-founded by Sriram Subramanian, the former head of cloud engineering at Confluent, and Gwen Shapira, the former engineering lead for the Kafka team at Confluent, Nile is building this new data solution with built-in support for multi-tenancy as its core primitives.\nThe company today announced that it has raised an $11.6 million seed funding round led by Benchmark\u2019s Eric Vishria, who was also the original lead investor of Confluent.\n\u201cWhile my team built the multi-tenant product for Confluent, it didn\u2019t dawn on me that this is something that every SaaS in the world is multi-tenant, everyone needs to handle multi-tenant data \u2014 and we have to keep building these things from scratch because there is no existing system that does it,\u201d Shapira told me.\nSubramanian noted that virtually every database on the market today was built as a general-purpose tool. \u201cWhen you do that, you end up having to build something that is the least common denominator across all the different use cases,\u201d he explained. \u201cBased on our experience making Confluent a SaaS company for six years, we found a lot of challenges in actually leveraging the database the way we wanted to \u2014 and not just the database itself but also solving all the data problems around it that were all essentially dealing with integrating with the database. This could be authentication, billing, and so on.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, that\u2019s exactly the problem Nile tries to solve. The idea here is that every SaaS company has a data layer at its core and since we are talking about SaaS companies, they all have to solve for multi-tenancy in some form or another, no matter whether they are in the B2B or B2C space.\nTypically, that involved either overprovisioning servers to be able to react to spikes \u2014 and accepting the additional cost of doing that \u2014 or moving specific customers to their own databases and clusters to ensure isolation (for both security and performance reasons).\n\u201cWe have a lot of stories of incidents from well-known companies that we talked to that had this one tenant impacting another incident, or they upgraded \u2014 or didn\u2019t upgrade \u2014 and that adversely affected some of the other customers. They needed to roll back, but only for some of the customers, and it ended up being a weeks-long incident as they manually tried to do surgical changes for the right customers. It\u2019s a problem that felt endemic,\u201d Shapira said.\nImage Credits: Nile\nTraditionally, the team argued, solving problems around data and database management was always an application problem rather than a database problem. Nile is turning this on its head by making multi-tenancy a core feature of its Postgres solution and by separating the data layer from the compute layer. That means users can connect a virtual tenant database either to a shared compute service or attach a dedicated compute node to it, for example. Developers just need to define which database the application needs to speak to and Nile then provides the isolation at the session and \u2014 coming soon \u2014 the connection level.\nWhy Postgres? According to Subramanian, that\u2019s where the market is going. Virtually every company the team talked to was betting on Postgres. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that it\u2019s going to become the Linux of databases,\u201d he said. The fact that it\u2019s open source and easily extensible also enables Nile to do what it does.\n\u201cWe talked to hundreds of SaaS companies and when you ask them, How do you do queues? How do you manage jobs? How do you do analytics? How do you do unstructured data? How do you do big data? How do you do this? How do you do that? And every time it\u2019s, Oh, we do it in Postgres. Can Postgres do that? Oh, yeah, absolutely,\u201d\u00a0 Shapira explained. \u201cDoes that do it as well as alternatives? Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. But for SaaS companies, 90% of the time, they seem to be extremely happy doing absolutely everything with Postgres.\u201d\nOn top of speeding up development, since the developers won\u2019t have to build their own systems for managing multiple tenants and the authentication layer needed for that, the Nile team also argues that its service can reduce cost by centralizing databases in a single location (even as tenants may be in different places) and by making it easier to scale through horizontal sharding.\nOn top of all this, Nile also offers features for user management, customer dashboards, vector embeddings for AI use cases (based on pgvector) and more. The company offers a limited free plan (currently behind a waitlist), with paid plans still in the works.\n",

      "content": "\nInngest, a startup that makes it easier for developers to build and manage serverless backends, today announced that it has raised a $6.1 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz, with follow-on investments from GGV, Afore Capital and Vercel CEO and co-founder Guillermo Rauch, who all participated in the company\u2019s $3 million seed round.\nAt its core, Inngest allows developers to focus on building their serverless, event-driven backend workflows without having to worry about the infrastructure and the workflow execution and queuing mechanisms to make that work at scale. Indeed, it was working with increasingly larger customers \u2014 SoundCloud, for example, recently moved its video generation and transcoding workflows to Inngest \u2014 that led the team to build many of its most recent additions to the service.\nImage Credits: Inngest\nAs Inngest founders Tony Holdstock-Brown (CEO) and Dan Farrelly (CTO) told me, the team added new flow control features, for example, which now make it easier to manage concurrency down to the user level. This helps developers build and manage multi-tenant applications and makes it easier to handle high-volume workloads but also provides more controls for companies that want to deploy AI workloads in production, given that these resources are scarce and prone to latency.\nInngest\u2019s focus early on was on building what the team likes to call \u201cdurable workflows,\u201d that is, workflows that can sleep for a long time if nothing is happening and then pick up the slack again quickly as needed. Inngest will handle the queues and database state for these functions and the developers don\u2019t have to do anything special to make that work. Combining that with the new flow control features, Inngest argues, is unlocking a lot of new capabilities for users.\n\u201cWe realized that as people were bringing durable workflows [to Inngest], there was a gap there in terms of how you actually build production applications,\u201d Farrelly told me. \u201cThe durability and the reliability, which we have, combined with the flow control aspect allows you to build into this reliability layer. It\u2019s like, alright, well, how am I managing my resources? Who\u2019s getting to run the jobs? One thing that we learned in the last six months was that as more enterprises came to us, they needed both [durable workflows and flow control] \u2014 and they work perfectly together.\u201d\nImage Credits: Inngest\nA lot of companies are now building their applications on top of AI \u2014 be those homegrown models or from vendors like OpenAI \u2014 and their users are competing for limited resources. \u201cThe way that we\u2019ve built our multi-level virtual queues allows you to manage the throughput across a whole set of users with much greater control. In the last few months, we also added prioritization to it as well, which also helps when everyone\u2019s going through the same place, competing for the same OpenAI or your model resources,\u201d Farrelly said.\nThe Inngest team also expanded its language support from only offering a TypeScript SDK to also offering Python and Go SDKs \u2014 and users can migrate between them as needed without having to shut down their functions. \u201cWe did start out serverless and TypeScript, but that\u2019s not everything,\u201d Holdstock-Brown said. \u201cWe ended up doing a Python SDK and Go SDK, and interestingly, if you rewrite your functions from TypeScript to Go, for example \u2014 if you\u2019ve got this long-running function that might take a year to finish, the state carries over, you can do live language migrations, you can do cloud migrations.\u201d\nTwo other new features the team recently launched are Replay, which allows teams to recover from incidents by re-running any failed jobs in bulk, and new\u00a0observability tools.\nHoldstock-Brown noted that the team plans to use the new funding to grow the team and ensure that Inngest, which, after all, provides a core service for its customers, is as reliable as possible, even as it scales to support more users.\n\u201cWe\u2019re particularly choosy about who we hire, but we\u2019re growing and we need to hire more people in order to make things work,\u201d he said. \u201cLuckily, we did a lot of upfront work to plan and build and architect our systems accordingly before starting the company, so I think it\u2019s just honestly building up more in-demand things and it is shoring up the system.\u201d\nHe also noted that as enterprises moved to Inngest, they realized that they are already sending a lot of their data through its system, so now they are asking the company to help them export this data to their data warehouses, for example, and to perform ETL on it. If there\u2019s one unifying trend in the enterprise space right now, it\u2019s businesses looking to consolidate where they are spending their money. So if a single tool can do multiple jobs, that\u2019s a huge selling point.\n\nInngest helps developers build their back-end workflows, raises $3M\n\n",

But GPUs are becoming tougher to procure, as companies of all sizes increase their investments in AI-powered products.\nNvidia\u2019s best-performing AI cards sold out last year, and the CEO of chipmaker TSMC suggested that general supply could be constrained into 2025. The problem\u2019s so acute, in fact, that it has the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s attention \u2014 the agency recently announced it\u2019s investigating several partnerships between AI startups and cloud giants like Google and AWS over whether the startups might have anti-competitive, privileged access to GPU compute.\nWhat\u2019s the solution? It depends on your resources, really. Tech giants like Meta, Google, Amazon and Microsoft are buying up what GPUs they can and developing their own custom chips. Ventures with fewer resources are at the mercy of the market \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way forever, say John Yue and Michael Yu.\nYue and Yu are the co-founders of Inference.ai, a platform that provides infrastructure-as-a-service cloud GPU compute through partnerships with third-party data centers. Inference uses algorithms to match companies\u2019 workloads with GPU resources, Yue says \u2014 aiming to take the guesswork out of choosing and acquiring infrastructure.\n\u201cInference brings clarity to the confusing hardware landscape for founders and developers with new chips coming from Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Groq [and so on] \u2014 allowing higher throughput, lower latency and lower cost,\u201d Yue said. \u201cOur tools and team allow for decision-makers to filter out a lot of the noise and quickly find the right fit for their project.\u201d\nInference essentially provides customers a GPU instance in the cloud, along with 5TB of object storage. The company claims that \u2014 thanks to its algorithmic matching tech and deals with data center operators \u2014 it can offer dramatically cheaper GPU compute with better availability than major public cloud providers.\n\u201cThe hosted GPU market is confusing and changes daily,\u201d Yue said. \u201cPlus, we\u2019ve seen pricing vary up to 1,000% for the same configuration. Our tools and team allow for decision makers to filter out a lot of the noise and quickly find the right fit for their project.\u201d\nNow, TechCrunch wasn\u2019t able to put those claims to the test. But regardless of whether they\u2019re true, Inference has competition \u2014 and lots of it.\nSee: CoreWeave, a crypto mining operation-turned-GPU provider, which is reportedly expected to rake in around $1.5 billion in revenue by 2024. Its close competitor, Lambda Labs, secured $300 million in venture capital last October. There\u2019s also Together \u2014 a GPU cloud \u2014 not to mention startups like Run.ai and Exafunction, which aim to reduce AI dev costs by abstracting away the underlying hardware.\nInference\u2019s investors seem to think there\u2019s room for another player, though. The startup recently closed a $4 million round from Cherubic Ventures, Maple VC and Fusion Fund, which Yue says is being put toward building out Inference\u2019s deployment infrastructure.\nIn an emailed statement, Cherubic\u2019s Matt Cheng added:\n\u201cThe requirements for processing capacity will keep on increasing as AI is the foundation of so many of today\u2019s products and systems. We\u2019re confident that the Inference team, with their past knowledge in hardware and cloud infrastructure, has what it takes to succeed. We decided to invest because accelerated computing and storage services are driving the AI revolution, and Inference product will fuel the next wave of AI growth.\u201d\n",

      "content": "\nBlock, the fintech company whose subsidiaries include Square, Cash App and Afterpay, is laying off staff at a tumultuous time for tech industry workers.\nThat\u2019s according to an internal memo from CEO Jack Dorsey, obtained first by Business Insider, which states that \u201cthe growth of [Block] has far outpaced the growth of \u2026 business and revenue.\u201d\nThe layoffs were executed this morning and affected staff in the Cash App, foundational and Square arms of Block. Reportedly, around 1,000 people \u2014 or 10% of Block\u2019s headcount \u2014 were impacted.\n\u201cWe decided it would be better to do at once rather than arbitrarily space them out, which didn\u2019t seem fair to the individuals or to the company,\u201d said Dorsey in the note to Block staff. \u201cWhen we know we need to take an action, we want to take it immediately, rather than let things linger on forever.\u201d\nThe firings don\u2019t come as a total surprise. Block said in an earnings call last year that it would reduce its headcount from 13,000 in Q3 2023 to an \u201cabsolute cap\u201d of 12,000 by the end of this year.\nBut they add to a sense of malaise in the fintech and broader tech sector, which has seen tens of thousands of workers let go in the past few weeks.\nJust today, PayPal said\u00a0it would fire some 2,500 people, or 9% of the company. Last week, Brex, the expense management startup, laid off 282, or 20% of its staff. And Treasure Financial, a platform offering cash management software for businesses, let 14 employees go, leaving the company with about a third of its former workforce.\nBlock\u2019s suffered a difficult, downward-trending year and change.\nRevenues from Cash App, the peer-to-peer payments service, have declined steeply. Meanwhile, the buy now, pay later service Afterpay, which Block acquired in 2021 for $29 billion, has posted serious losses. Block\u2019s Bitcoin revenue has fallen corresponding with the\u00a0fall in the price of the cryptocurrency last year (although that\u2019s recovered recently). And Square faces growing competition on multiple fronts, including from Fiserv\u2019s Clover, Toast and Stripe.\nInvestors are displeased. Square stock retreated around 30% from January 2023 to October as Block founder Dorsey took the reigns from ex-Square head Alyssa Henry.\nBlock\u2019s recent attempts to reinvigorate business include adding generative AI features to Square, acquiring music-focused fintech startup Hifi and launching a self-custody Bitcoin wallet, Bitkey, in the form of a mobile app and hardware storage.\nBlock reported $5.62 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2023, with $44 million in profit on its Bitcoin holdings.\n",

      "content": "\nSpend management startup Ramp has acquired AI-powered startup Venue as it expands its procurement offering.\nVenue was founded in 2022 by TK Kong, Young Kim, and Kevin Chan, and its aim was to \u201csimplify how businesses review, approve, and manage the cost of vendors in use across their company.\u201d\nThe startup raised $1.2 million in funding from investors such as Sequoia Capital, Exponent Founders Capital and Basecase Capital. Ramp actually acquired the company last August but only announced it today. Kong was tapped to serve as Ramp\u2019s head of procurement after the buy.\n\u201cWe waited to announce the close of the acquisition until today\u2019s meaningful set of procurement and vendor management launches because we wanted customers to be able to experience the value of the team\u2019s hard work on the same day they read about the news,\u201d Ramp CEO and co-founder Eric Glyman told TechCrunch via email.\nThe procurement team has over a dozen people including Venue\u2019s three co-founders, Glyman said.\nThe acquisition makes sense considering that last summer, Ramp announced that it was entering the procurement space as it focused more on \u201ccomplex\u201d enterprises. Plus, it believes that back-end business processes like procurement are \u201cripe for practical automation and AI implementations.\u201d\n\u201cOur plans are to grow this segment and serve more businesses with simple software that transforms a clunky, slow, and painful process into an efficient and organized one,\u201d Glyman said. \u201cThis way, we\u2019re enabling customers to put money movement at the center of their decision-making and helping them build stronger, more sustainable businesses for the long-term.\u201d\nToday, Ramp claims to power over $10 billion in accounts payable spend each year, a 10x increase in just over two years, execs say. Its self-proclaimed goal is to become \u201ca one-stop-shop for all financial operations.\u201d\n\u201cEliminating the inefficiencies across the entire financial tech stack is a prime use case for AI to handle the busy work of work,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe product updates announced today go to show how AI and automation will upend back-end business processes and make it easier and more frictionless to operate and work at a modern business.\u201d\nIn the past few years, Ramp has been on what might look like a buying spree. In August of 2021, Ramp purchased Buyer, a \u201cnegotiation-as-a-service\u201d platform that claimed to save its clients money on big-ticket purchases such as annual software contracts. Then last year, Ramp acquired Cohere.io, a startup that built an AI-powered customer support tool.\nGlyman said the integration with Cohere was move \u201cahead of expectations.\u201d The Cohere and Applied AI team at Ramp already launched products under Ramp Intelligence, Ramp\u2019s\u00a0Teams Integration and a dozen internal use cases that have made customer experience, account management, and sales teams meaningfully more productive.\n\u201cOne such feature launched today that we\u2019re particularly excited about is called Seat Intelligence, which tracks actual software usage \u2014 against the number of seats businesses are getting billed for \u2014 to ensure businesses are getting their money\u2019s worth from SaaS contracts,\u201d Glyman said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very well received from test and design partners that we\u2019ve worked with up to this point, so we\u2019re excited to roll it out more broadly.\u201d\nMeanwhile, in August of 2022, Ramp confirmed it had raised $300 million in a funding round co-led by existing backer Thrive Capital and new investor Sands Capital at a post-money valuation of $5.8 billion. At the time, it said it had passed $300 million in annualized revenue.\nJan. 30 \u2013 the story was edited to add additional comments from Eric Glyman.\n\nInside Brex and Ramp\u2019s AI ambitions\n\n",

Specifically, across our organization, we need to drive more focus and efficiency, deploy automation, and consolidate our technology to reduce complexity and duplication.

Chriss joined the company in September as its CEO after spending 19 years at Intuit. Soon after taking the helm, Chriss said he expected \u201cto grow revenue outside of purely transaction-related volume,\u201d as reported by Reuters. In November, Archie Deskus transitioned from serving as the company\u2019s chief information officer to serve as its chief technology officer. Jamie Miller was tapped to serve as its chief financial officer.\nPayPal has expanded over the years with its acquisitions of fintech such as Venmo, Xoom and Honey. But it has still struggled to compete with the likes of Apple and Stripe. In December, TechCrunch reported that Amazon was dropping Venmo as a payment option. In October, PayPal was hit with a class action lawsuit\u00a0by consumers represented by law firm Hagens Berman alleging that the fintech giant\u2019s anti-steering rules stifle competition against lower-cost payment platforms such as Stripe and Shopify.\nAnd in May of 2022, we reported that PayPal had laid off dozens of employees from its San Jose headquarters.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

As she departs Twitch, she has 9.3 million followers, making her the tenth most-followed user. As one of the first women of color to emerge to Twitch stardom in a male-dominated gaming culture, Pokimane\u2019s influence is palpable.\n\u201cWhat an incredible journey it\u2019s been,\u201d Twitch\u2019s X account responded to Pokimane\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of everything you\u2019ve accomplished and what\u2019s ahead in the future. You\u2019ll always have a home on Twitch, Poki.\u201d\nOver the last few years, many top streamers have left Twitch for exclusive deals with other platforms like YouTube, or the newer Kick. Kick offers creators 95% of their subscription revenue, which is a huge upgrade over Twitch\u2019s 50-50 baseline split; streamers in Twitch\u2019s Partner Plus program can make a 70-30 split.\nTwitch is in a period of disarray. The Amazon-owned platform has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs in the last year as it struggles to turn a profit \u2014 in 2024 alone, Twitch has laid off 500 employees, who made up 35% of the workforce. The company shut down service in South Korea, one of the world\u2019s largest esports markets, and it sowed discord in its community over confusing and ever-changing payout structures.\nThough Kick gives creators a better revenue share, the grass isn\u2019t necessarily greener. Kick is notoriously lax when it comes to content moderation, and has become the new home for some streamers who were banned from Twitch. One such streamer is Adin Ross, who used his Kick to livestream porn and platform self-described neo-Nazis. Some streamers have also turned to Kick because it allows gambling content, which Twitch banned last year.\nPokimane isn\u2019t likely to be taking her talents to Kick, though. In June, she said in a stream that profiting from Kick would compromise her \u201cmorals and ethics.\u201d\nPerhaps it\u2019s just time for Pokimane to take a break from the internet. Recently, some high-profile YouTube creators like MatPat and Tom Scott have announced their retirement, sparking discourse about how creators decide when it\u2019s time to move on.\nWithout her word, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s next for Pokimane, but her departure from Twitch is a monumental moment for the struggling platform.\n\nTwitch announces 60/40 revenue split in expanded Plus Program\n\n",

      "content": "\nMove over, TikTok,\u00a0Ofcom, the U.K. regulator enforcing the now official Online Safety Act, is gearing up to size up an even bigger target: search engines like Google and Bing and the role that they play in presenting self-injury, suicide and other harmful content at the click of a button, particularly to underage users.\nA report commissioned by Ofcom and produced by the Network Contagion Research Institute found that major search engines, including Google, Microsoft\u2019s Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo and AOL become \u201cone-click gateways\u201d to such content by facilitating easy, quick access to web pages, images and videos \u2014 with one out of every five search results around basic self-injury terms linking to further harmful content.\nThe research is timely and significant because a lot of the focus around harmful content online in recent times has been around the influence and use of walled-garden social media sites like Instagram and TikTok. This new research is, significantly, a first step in helping Ofcom understand and gather evidence of whether there is a much larger potential threat, with open-ended sites like Google.com attracting more than 80 billion visits per month, compared to TikTok monthly active users of around 1.7 billion.\n\u201cSearch engines are often the starting point for people\u2019s online experience, and we\u2019re concerned they can act as one-click gateways to seriously harmful self-injury content,\u201d said Almudena Lara, Online Safety Policy Development director at Ofcom, in a statement. \u201cSearch services need to understand their potential risks and the effectiveness of their protection measures \u2014 particularly for keeping children safe online \u2014 ahead of our wide-ranging consultation due in Spring.\u201d\nResearchers analyzed some 37,000 result links across those five search engines for the report, Ofcom said. Using both common and more cryptic search terms (cryptic to try to evade basic screening), they intentionally ran searches turning off \u201csafe search\u201d parental screening tools, to mimic the most basic ways that people might engage with search engines as well as the worst-case scenarios.\nThe results were in many ways as bad and damning as you might guess.\nNot only did 22% of the search results produce single-click links to harmful content (including instructions for various forms of self-harm), but that content accounted for a full 19% of the top-most links in the results (and 22% of the links down the first pages of results).\nImage searches were particularly egregious, the researchers found, with a full 50% of these returning harmful content for searches, followed by web pages at 28% and video at 22%. The report concludes that one reason that some of these may not be getting screened out better by search engines is because algorithms may confuse self-harm imagery with medical and other legitimate media.\nThe cryptic search terms were also better at evading screening algorithms: These made it six times more likely that a user might reach harmful content.\nOne thing that is not touched on in the report, but is likely to become a bigger issue over time, is the role that generative AI searches might play in this space. So far, it appears that there are more controls being put into place to prevent platforms like ChatGPT from being misused for toxic purposes. The question will be whether users will figure out how to game that, and what that might lead to.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already working to build an in-depth understanding of the opportunities and risks of new and emerging technologies, so that innovation can thrive, while the safety of users is protected. Some applications of generative AI are likely to be in scope of the Online Safety Act and we would expect services to assess risks related to its use when carrying out their risk assessment,\u201d an Ofcom spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nIt\u2019s not all a nightmare: Some 22% of search results were also flagged for being helpful in a positive way.\nThe report may be getting used by Ofcom to get a better idea of the issue at hand, but it is also an early signal to search engine providers of what they will need to be prepared to work on. Ofcom has already been clear to say that children will be its first focus in enforcing the Online Safety Bill. In the spring, Ofcom plans to open a consultation on its Protection of Children Codes of Practice, which aims to set out \u201cthe practical steps search services can take to adequately protect children.\u201d\nThat will include taking steps to minimize the chances of children encountering harmful content around sensitive topics like suicide or eating disorders across the whole of the internet, including on search engines.\n\u201cTech firms that don\u2019t take this seriously can expect Ofcom to take appropriate action against them in future,\u201d the Ofcom spokesperson said. That will include fines (which Ofcom said it would use only as a last resort) and in the worst scenarios, court orders requiring ISPs to block access to services that do not comply with rules. There potentially also could be criminal liability for executives who oversee services that violate the rules.\nSo far, Google has taken issue with some of the report\u2019s findings and how it characterizes its efforts, claiming that its parental controls do a lot of the important work that invalidate some of these findings.\n\u201cWe are fully committed to keeping people safe online,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cOfcom\u2019s study does not reflect the safeguards that we have in place on Google Search and references terms that are rarely used on Search. Our SafeSearch feature, which filters harmful and shocking search results, is on by default for users under 18, whilst the SafeSearch blur setting \u2014 a feature which blurs explicit imagery, such as self-harm content \u2014 is on by default for all accounts. We also work closely with expert organisations and charities to ensure that when people come to Google Search for information about suicide, self-harm or eating disorders, crisis support resource panels appear at the top of the page.\u201d\nMicrosoft and DuckDuckGo have so far not responded to a request for comment.\n",

      "content": "\nUniversal Music Group (UMG), the label representing artists such as Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande, says that it\u2019ll pull its music from TikTok tomorrow at midnight after failing to reach a deal with the platform\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, over royalties.\nUMG won\u2019t seek to renew its current arrangement with TikTok, set to expire on January 31, and plans to cease licensing content to both TikTok and its music-focused service, TikTok Music.\nIn a press release, UMG accused TikTok \u2014 which reportedly made close to $20 billion in ad revenue last year \u2014 of trying to build a \u201cmusic-based business without paying fair value for [artists\u2019] music.\u201d\n\u201cTikTok proposed paying our artists and songwriters at a rate that is a fraction of the rate that similarly situated major social platforms pay,\u201d the label wrote. \u201cToday, as an indication of how little TikTok compensates artists and songwriters, despite its massive and growing user base, rapidly rising advertising revenue and increasing reliance on music-based content, TikTok accounts for only about 1% of our total revenue.\u201d\nTikTok didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. But later in the evening, a spokesperson emailed this statement:\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad and disappointing that Universal Music Group has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters. Despite Universal\u2019s false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent. TikTok has been able to reach \u2018artist-first\u2019 agreements with every other label and publisher. Clearly, Universal\u2019s self-serving actions are not in the best interests of artists, songwriters and fans.\u201d\nThe way UMG tells it in the press release, TikTok and it didn\u2019t see eye to eye on payments for AI-generated recordings using UMG properties. In addition, TikTok wasn\u2019t taking appropriate steps to swiftly remove content in violation of the label\u2019s copyright, UMG says.\n\u201cUltimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music,\u201d UMG wrote.\nUMG\u2019s current contract with TikTok dates back to 2021 and covers recorded music from artists at UMG\u2019s labels and songwriters associated with Universal Music Publishing Group. As a part of the deal, UMG and TikTok agreed to experiment with new features, like allowing users to incorporate clips from UMG\u2019s full catalog of music spanning Bad Bunny, SZA, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Harry Styles, Justin Bieber, Adele, U2 and Elton John.\nThe fallout with UMG comes as TikTok leans more heavily into music creation and curation.\nThe platform is positioning TikTok Music, which launched last year in select countries, as a serious Spotify and Apple Music rival. Meanwhile, TikTok is piloting an \u201cAI Song\u201d feature that uses AI to create songs based on prompts that users enter.\nWhile TikTok has shown a willingness to engage with certain labels on terms it finds favorable \u2014 the platform was reportedly in talks with Warner Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and UMG \u201call year\u201d in 2022 and 2023 for a share of its ad revenues \u2014 it hasn\u2019t been shy about throwing its weight around where it sees fit. Last February, TikTok removed major record company music from its service for a subset of users in Australia in an apparent test to see how user engagement would be impacted.\nRecently, TikTok has sought to ink exclusive distribution deals with musicians for ByteDance\u2019s SoundOn service, which distributes directly to TikTok and music streaming services. It\u2019s also launched a program called Elevate, designed to identify the next wave of rising artists in the music industry.\n",

      "title": "CEOs from Meta, TikTok, Snap, X and Discord head to Congress for kids\u2019 online safety hearing",
      "content": "\nCEOs from some of the biggest social platforms will appear before Congress on Wednesday to defend their companies against mounting criticism that they have done too little to protect kids and teens online.\nThe hearing, set to begin at 10 a.m. ET, is the latest in a long string of congressional tech hearings stretching back for years, with little in the way of new regulation or policy change to show for the efforts.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will host the latest hearing, which is notable mostly for dragging five chief executives across the country to face a barrage of questions from lawmakers. Tech companies often placate Congress by sending legal counsel or a policy executive, but the latest hearing will feature a slate of CEOs: Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, X (formerly Twitter) CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok\u2019s \u200b\u200bShou Chew, Discord\u2019s Jason Citron and Evan Spiegel of Snap. Zuckerberg and Chew are the only executives who agreed to appear at the hearing voluntarily without a subpoena.\nWhile Zuckerberg is a veteran of these often lengthy, meandering attempts to hold tech companies to account, Wednesday\u2019s televised hearing will be a first for Yaccarino, Spiegel and Citron. Snap and X have sent other executives (or their former chief executive) in the past, but Discord \u2014 a chat app originally designed for gamers \u2014 is making its first appearance in the hot seat. All three first-timers could produce some interesting off-script moments, particularly Yaccarino. In recent interviews as X\u2019s top executive, Elon Musk\u2019s pick to lead the company has appeared flustered and combative \u2014 a world apart from her media overtrained peers like Zuckerberg and Chew.\nDiscord is a very popular app among young people, but it\u2019s still an unusual name to come up in one of these hearings. The committee\u2019s decision to include Discord is likely a result of a report last year from NBC News exploring sextortion and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the chat platform. The company\u2019s inclusion is notable, particularly in light of the absence of more prominent algorithm-powered social networks like YouTube \u2014 often inexplicably absent from these events \u2014 and the absence of Amazon-owned livestreaming giant Twitch.\nWednesday\u2019s hearing, titled \u201cBig Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis,\u201d will cover much more ground than its narrow naming would suggest. Lawmakers will likely dig into an array of concerns \u2014 both recent and ongoing \u2014 about how social platforms fail to protect their young users from harmful content. That includes serious concerns around Instagram openly connecting sexual predators with sellers advertising CSAM, as the WSJ previously reported, and the NBC News investigation revealing that Discord has facilitated dozens of instances of grooming, kidnapping and other instances of sexual exploitation in recent years.\nBeyond concerns that social platforms don\u2019t do enough to protect kids from sexual predation, expect lawmakers to press the five tech CEOs on other online safety concerns, like fentanyl sellers on Snapchat, booming white supremacist extremism on X and the prevalence of self harm and suicide content on TikTok. And given the timing of X\u2019s embarrassing failure to prevent a recent explosion of explicit AI-generated Taylor Swift imagery and the company\u2019s amateurish response, expect some Taylor Swift questions too.\nThe tech companies are likely to push back, pointing lawmakers to platform and policy changes in some cases designed to make these apps safer, and in others engineered mostly to placate Congress in time for this hearing. In Meta\u2019s case, that looks like an update to Instagram and Facebook last week that prevents teens from receiving direct messages from users they don\u2019t know. Like many of these changes from companies like Meta, it raises the question of why these safeguards continue to be added on the fly instead of being built into the product before it was offered to young users.\nKOSA looms large\nThis time around, the hearing is part of a concerted push to pass the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), a controversial piece of legislation that ostensibly forces tech platforms to take additional measures to shield children from harmful content online. In spite of some revisions, the bill\u2019s myriad critics caution that KOSA would aggressively sanitize the internet, promote censorship and imperil young LGBTQ people in the process. Some of the bill\u2019s conservative supporters \u2014 including co-sponsor Sen. Marsha Blackburn \u2014 have stated outright that KOSA should be used to effectively erase transgender content for young people online.\nThe LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD expressed its concerns about the hearing and related legislation in a statement provided to TechCrunch, urging lawmakers to ensure that \u201cproposed solutions be carefully crafted\u201d to avoid negatively impacting the queer community.\n\u201cThe US Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing is likely to feature anti-LGBTQ lawmakers baselessly attempting to equate age-appropriate LGBTQ resources and content with inappropriate material,\u201d GLAAD said. \u201c\u2026 Parents and youth do need action to address Big Tech platforms\u2019 harmful business practices, but age-appropriate information about the existence of LGBTQ people should not be grouped in with such content.\u201d\nThe ACLU and digital rights organization the EFF have also opposed the legislation, as have other groups concerned about the bill\u2019s implications for encryption. Similar concerns have followed the Children and Teens\u2019 Online Privacy Protection Act (now known as \u201cCOPPA 2.0\u201c), the STOP CSAM Act and\u00a0the EARN IT Act, adjacent bills purporting to protect children online.\nThe bill\u2019s proponents aren\u2019t all conservative. KOSA enjoys bipartisan support at the moment and the misgivings expressed by its critics haven\u2019t broken through to the many Democratic lawmakers who are on board. The bill is also backed by organizations that promote children\u2019s safety online, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation and Fairplay, a nonprofit focused on protecting kids online.\n\u201cKOSA is a needed corrective to social media platforms\u2019 toxic business model, which relies on maximizing engagement by any means necessary, including sending kids down deadly rabbit holes and implementing features that make young people vulnerable to exploitation and abuse,\u201d Josh Golin, executive director of Fairplay, said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. Fairplay has also organized a pro-KOSA coalition of parents who have lost children in connection with cyberbullying, drugs purchased on social platforms and other online harms.\nAs of last week, KOSA\u2019s unlikeliest supporter is one of the companies that the bill seeks to regulate. Snap split from its peers last week to throw its support behind KOSA, a move likely intended to endear the company to regulators that could steer its fate \u2014 or perhaps more importantly, the fate of TikTok, Snap\u2019s dominant rival, which sucks\u00a0up the lion\u2019s share of screen time among young people.\nSnap\u2019s decision to break rank with its tech peers and even its own industry group on KOSA echoes a similar move by Meta, then Facebook, to support a controversial pair of laws known as FOSTA-SESTA back in 2018. That legislation, touted as a solution to online sex trafficking, went on to become law, but years later FOSTA-SESTA is better known for driving sex workers away from safe online spaces than it is for disrupting sex trafficking.\n\nFan fiction writers rally fandoms against KOSA, the bill purporting to protect kids online\n\n",

      "content": "\n\nSpaceX is teaming up with Northrop Grumman today to deliver more than 8,000 pounds of cargo, fresh food and scientific experiments to astronauts on the International Space Station.\nThe NG-20 resupply mission will take off from the Space Force\u2019s Cape Canaveral in Florida on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at around 12:07 p.m. EST. Northrop\u2019s Cygnus cargo capsule will arrive at the International Space Station on February 1.\nNorthrop has been launching Cygnus to the ISS for resupply missions using its own Antares rocket since 2013, with the exception of just two missions that used a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5. But Northrop retired that version of Antares last year, and the next version \u2014 an all-American launch vehicle called Antares 330, which it is developing with Firefly Aerospace \u2014 will not be ready to fly until around mid-2025.\nBoth Northrop and SpaceX have multibillion-dollar contracts with NASA to deliver cargo resupply missions to the ISS. Under its contract, SpaceX uses its Dragon capsule; this is the first time it will launch a Cygnus.\nThat Northrop is using Falcon 9 \u2014 and that the change required no modifications to Cynus, per Northrop VP Cyrus Dahlia during a press briefing last week \u2014 reflects both companies\u2019 critical importance to American civil space efforts.\nSpaceX was able to modify its own hardware to accommodate the spacecraft: William Gerstenmaier, SpaceX\u2019s VP of build and flight reliability, said during the briefing that the company added a 5 feet by 4 feet hatch to the payload fairing to enable a \u201clate load\u201d of cargo. Loading the cargo late in mission preparations, or within 24 hours of launch, allowed crews to add materials (like ice cream) to the spacecraft even after it was encapsulated in the fairing.\nAdding the \u201cgigadoor\u201d to the fairing, as Gerstenmaier called it, is especially tricky because the contents inside must remain environmentally controlled.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty intense activity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot of modifications on our part to get this hardware ready to go fly.\u201d\nCygnus will remain docked to the ISS for around six months. While attached, it may use its thrusters to boost the altitude of the station, which is subject to atmospheric drag \u2014 an important capability unique to Cygnus. At the end of its stint, astronauts will fill the spacecraft with trash and other debris, which will burn up in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n",

Fifteen companies are presenting in this batch, but here are several we thought worth a closer look. Alchemist also scored an additional $2 million from Mayfield to keep investing like this, so they must be doing something right.\nYou can watch the full set of presentations here when the stream starts at 10:30 a.m. Pacific time today.\nAvol Aerospace is basically an American take on Matternet\u2019s (also an Alchemist alumni) medical sample transport drones over in Switzerland. I\u2019ve written those up over the years and the concept is pretty high-touch but has genuine promise for improving times for getting labs done, transporting organs and blood, and so on, instead of using ground couriers.\nOf course in a Swiss city studded with medical centers you can get away with a quadcopter. If it\u2019s 50 miles, you want something like Zipline\u2019s fixed-wing craft. Avol has staked out an interesting middle ground: a small VTOL craft that transitions to winged flight after takeoff.

Imagine that!\n\nMatternet\u2019s automated drone-docking station makes its real-life debut in Switzerland\n\nOf course, in a sense that limits scaling, but the sample delivery industry isn\u2019t trying to go from 1 to a million, more like 10 to 100 over the next year. They\u2019re raising a seed round now and hoping to work with hospitals around the country.\nImage Credits: Avol\nSyntonym is taking the tech behind vtubers and applying it in everyday video calls, replacing your face in real time to preserve your privacy. Now, this isn\u2019t meant for meetings with your team or calls with your family, but rather in applications like in-car monitoring or telehealth, where a person\u2019s expressions and general look are needed, but they might rather not have their face going to some database.\nImage Credits: Syntonym\nIt can run as a cloud service, on-premise or even as a virtual camera on your phone (and a little on-screen indicator serves as notice that your face is not your face). It\u2019s an interesting play, but I do wonder whether it will be something people want to pay for as the culture around video calls and surveillance shifts. I wouldn\u2019t mind being able to put on a mask now and then, to be sure.\nExample of face replacement in an in-car dash camera system. Image Credits: Syntonym\nYes, there are ethical considerations. We should talk about them!\nElaitra is in the \u201cAI radiology assistant\u201d category, which is surprisingly broad since that kind of imaging is done increasingly frequently for an increasing number of conditions. In the case of breast cancer, imaging called Digital Breast Tomosynthesis can turn up precancerous or otherwise suspicious tissues, but it can be hard for even experts to read correctly 100% of the time.\n\nLike other screening and diagnosis assistants, Elaitra\u2019s Viewfinder software isn\u2019t in any way intended to replace expert analysis, but to help speed up and improve the expert\u2019s workflow. They\u2019re piloting the software now with some hospitals and clinics, and hope to make Viewfinder a standard, low-cost step in breast cancer screening and treatment.\nI don\u2019t pretend to understand what ERPs are used for day to day, since I\u2019m just a writer. But I\u2019ve heard in multiple industries that the old enterprise resource planning systems that companies have relied on for years just don\u2019t work well with a lot of modern workflows, especially in fast-moving industries or SMBs. So it\u2019s not surprising that folks from Astra were frustrated enough with what they were using to split off and build their own.\nRedshift is their solution, a new ERP-type thing that integrates with modern services everyone uses and doesn\u2019t cost a quarter of a million dollars. Look, I already said I don\u2019t know what these things are actually for, but I\u2019ve seen other companies spun out of the exacting processes of spaceflight and that\u2019s as good an origin story as any. Better than most, really.\nMayfield\u2019s $2 million investment is a follow-on from an earlier $500,000 one. It seems they\u2019re hungry for technical founders and Alchemist specializes in that, but they didn\u2019t attach any big riders to the check. \u201cIt\u2019s a very open-ended investment,\u201d said Alchemist CEO Ravi Belani. \u201cThey were an initial LP, so there\u2019s a lot of trust.\u201d\nThe accelerator is also trying a new model to reach out to founders across the globe that want a partner in the bay.\n\u201cThis is an experiment, to try to create bridges to pockets of the world where we don\u2019t have a good foothold,\u201d Belani explained, essentially by fast-tracking startups referred by partner firms. He gave the example of a VC firm in Turkey, Simya \u2014 which, incidentally, actually translates to Alchemist \u2014 which is one of the early partners.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to compete for the best startups in and around Turkey, but there are bigger funds than them,\u201d Belani said. \u201cIn the past, they\u2019d just have to go and compete with them, but now they can say, \u2018Hey, with our firm comes access to Alchemist in Silicon Valley. That gives them an edge. And if that company had decided to go direct to us, we would have only invested $50,000; now they\u2019re getting $250,000 from the partner \u2014 that\u2019s the minimum [for this program], but they can do more.\u201d\nWill it pay off? It could help connect the vast amounts of talent and capital that don\u2019t have convenient access to Silicon Valley \u2014 which is itself notoriously inward-looking.\n\nAlchemist Accelerator\u2019s latest startups range from sneakernet for energy to solar panel cleaning bots\n\n",

      "content": "\nPadSplit aims to address the lack of supply, access and affordability in the rental market with its co-living marketplace designed specifically for lower-income workers, which includes flexible commitment terms and payments as well as no minimum credit score or expensive security deposit.\nNow, the company has created more than 10,000 rooms in 18 cities across the U.S., giving over 23,000 people access to stable living accommodations \u2014 a notable milestone given the current housing crisis and how it affects individuals dealing with economic instability. According to a recent report by Moody\u2019s Analytics, researchers say it\u2019ll likely take years until we see a recovery in the American housing market, and despite it slightly improving, the total housing deficit will remain in the 1.5 million to 2 million range in 2024.\n\u201cThe largest portion of anyone\u2019s income almost always goes toward housing costs,\u201d founder and CEO Atticus LeBlanc told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd if you look around, you know that housing costs are skyrocketing, as much as 40% in some markets. Where can the baristas who serve your coffee or, the wait staff in a restaurant, or the person who cuts your hair afford to live? PadSplit fundamentally believes that the people who serve our communities deserve an opportunity to live in them. Our mission is to change the world, one room at a time.\u201d\nAlongside today\u2019s milestone announcement, PadSplit shared new data about its users, including how much they save per month on average ($332) and residents\u2019 median annual income ($27,636). Most notably, active members have saved $2.6 million monthly and around $47.4 million in total savings generated.\n\u201cThe life-changing results speak for themselves\u2026 These incredible results have led PadSplit residents to purchase their own vehicles, traditional apartments, launch their own companies and buy their own homes,\u201d added LeBlanc.\nWhen you look at the U.S. median monthly rent price \u2014 $1,966 as of November 2023 \u2014 housing continues to be unaffordable for minimum-wage employees. Additionally, the average cost of renting a room jumped from $755 in 2022 to $955 in 2023. PadSplit, meanwhile, reports that the average monthly cost to live in one of its units is $729.\nIn addition to offering furnished private bedrooms, shared common areas, fixed utility costs and Wi-Fi, PadSplit also offers 24/7 telehealth, credit reporting and job matching services, which could help set residents up for success. Members can move within 48 hours and pay on a customizable schedule.\nPadSplit has units available in select cities across 15 states, including Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia. It plans to expand to more cities in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Texas this year.\nSince its launch in 2017, PadSplit has raised $35.1 million in funding from noteworthy investors like Core Innovation Capital, Impact Engine and Mark Cuban Companies.\n\nPadSplit uses the Airbnb model to tackle the country\u2019s affordable housing crisis\n\n",

      "content": "\nThe venture capital market may still be trying to sort itself out, yet venture capital firms remain optimistic in closing new funds.\nUbiquity Ventures is the latest firm, securing another $75 million in capital commitments for its third fund. Sunil Nagaraj is the solo general partner at Ubiquity, having started the firm in 2017 and closed his debut fund of $30 million in 2018. He then raised $51 million in 2020 for Fund II.\nNagaraj, who was previously with Bessemer Venture Partners for six years, says he has \u201cthe power of being nerdy and early,\u201d which is what led to his 2014 seed investment in Auth0 while at that firm. The company eventually exited in a $5.6 billion deal to Okta.\nHe also said there has to be a delicate balance between mainstream SaaS, deep tech and off-the-deep-end moonshots.\n\u201cThose are the two ends of the spectrum,\u201d he said. \u201cThe danger is that once you do something outside the norm, you can go too far off the norm.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how a former Bessemer Venture Partners principal closed his own $30 million fund\n\nHe focuses on early-stage startups creating \u201csoftware beyond the screen,\u201d which he describes as the trend of having no screens, meaning using software to navigate, perceive, understand and control the real physical world. In other words, it can become \u201cubiquitous.\u201d\n\u201cThis is something I would love for the whole tech community to embrace more of,\u201d Nagaraj told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest idea that\u2019s not being exploited right now.\u201d\nInvestments include companies like Croptide, a company developing a \u201csmartwatch\u201d for plants that reads a plant\u2019s status from its stem; Halter, a way to control cows from your smartphone; Loft Orbital, a satellite-as-a-service company; and Revi, which makes kiosks and online ordering services for restaurants.\nHe has already made four investments from the new fund and plans to make about 20 overall, writing about $1 to $2 million for a seed round and reserving the same for the subsequent Series A. And Nagaraj takes a board seat, which he joked that many of his peers find odd at the seed stage.\nThree months ago, he created Ubiquity University, a series of educational videos for seed-stage entrepreneurs. For example, how to set up your first board meeting, your first financial model and how to build a cap table.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done about half of them myself,\u201d Nagaraj said. \u201cI\u2019m continuing to add to this as a free resource for the world. It\u2019s based on some of my pet peeves \u2014 entrepreneurs have been pitching like 100 times with different VCs. So what do they do at the first meeting? Pitch.

      "title": "p0 uses LLMs to save enterprises from code catastrophes",
      "content": "\nStartup p0 is named after catastrophic events that can cause a platform to crash, leading to potential security breaches and loss of customer trust in businesses. Those are the problems that p0 was created to solve, using large language models (LLMs) to help developers catch serious issues in code before it is shipped. The startup announced today it has raised $6.5 million from Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from Alchemy Ventures.\np0 uses LLMs to identify safety and security issues in software before it is run in a production environment, and it does not need user configuration. Software issues it addresses include data integrity, validation failures, speed and timeouts. Developers use it by connecting their Git code repositories to p0. One of p0\u2019s main customers is a large food service company with millions of live users on its system. They use p0 to find issues that can compromise the security and reliability of their platform. For example, p0 showed them that their sign-up sheets could\u2019t handle emojis.\nThe startup was founded in 2022 by Prakash Sanker, who previously worked at companies like Palantir, and Kunal Agarwal, a founder of SoftBank-funded working capital startup C2FO. The company was started to \u201cfundamentally change the manner in which code quality assurance is done,\u201d Sanker told TechCrunch.\n\u201cWhile building software at our previous companies, we always felt that getting something into production was painful, typically involving a really boring and time-consuming bug bash process,\u201d he says. \u201cOur developers were always balancing the demands of shipping product or spending time writing tests.\u201d\nSanker and Agarwal decided to build a one-click tool that could identify p0s before they affect customers, while shortening software delivery cycles. Sanker says the quality assurance tools currently used by developers, which typically focus on static analysis, security analysis, test writing or test execution, are less precise and require a lot of engagement and ingenuity to discover p0s.\np0\u2019s founders say it is able to be part of the development process without slowing it down because it revolves around LLMs.\nAgarwal explains that enterprises traditionally do security testing with a black box approach, which means external white hat hackers or security systems try to attack their systems without a deep knowledge of the system. Or internal developers who are very familiar with the system try to attack it. \u201cTypically, it\u2019s been very hard to know the internals of systems just by looking at code externally,\u201d he said.\np0 uses LLMs to understand its customer\u2019s codebases and create contextual challenges that have the potential to exploit vulnerabilities. For example, it can detect an API vulnerability that might give away private information when hit with a specific data payload.\n\u201cWithout LLMs, it would be impossible to create a contextually relevant challenge,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cThis is critical because understanding context powers the system with intelligence and mounting a relevant challenge enables us to reduce noise.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s engine is currently powered by open source LLMs, including Llama and Mistral. p0 extracts the relevant parts of a customer\u2019s codebase and embeds it with the right context and query for its LLM engine to respond to, Agarwal explained. Then it examines those responses and makes them readable by humans. As p0 develops, it plans to refine its model weights. For enterprise customers, LLMs are hosted within their environment for information security reasons.\nAgarwal says hallucinations aren\u2019t a challenge for the startup, because it doesn\u2019t write code. Instead, it mounts challenges and it can detect challenges created by hallucinations.\np0 has launched from stealth and is revenue generating thanks to its first customer (the global food service provider). Sanker says it has 50 customers in its pipeline who will be onboarded in 2024 and monetizes through a SaaS model. In the future, it wants to include staging environments as an offering.\nOther plans include expanding p0\u2019s capability for finding different types of critical issues and supporting more languages. The founders also want to get rid of the need for a customer-hosted staging environment and turn p0 into an end-to-end solution.\nIn an investor statement, Lightspeed partner Hemant Mohapatra said, \u201cp0\u2019s cutting-edge approach to code and API security is unique and amongst the first ever truly LLM-native ways of solving this age-old and ever-evolving problem. We are excited to have incubated and backed them from when this was just an idea on paper.\u201d\n",

      "content": "\nA Delaware judge ruled Tuesday that Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion\u00a0pay package is unfair, voiding the largest in compensation deal in corporate history.\nThe decision, issued Tuesday in the Delaware Court of Chancery by Judge Kathaleen McCormick, means that Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, can\u2019t keep the 2018 compensation package. The ruling can be appealed. Chancery Daily, which follows and shares update on the Delaware Chancery Court, first reported the decision on Threads.\nThe ruling doesn\u2019t provide a tidy end for Musk or the Tesla board. How Musk is compensated and what happens to his wealth, which is largely tied up in his many companies, are unanswered questions.\nIn her ruling, McCormick wrote that Tesla \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d\nMusk shared his displeasure with the ruling by turning to X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter that he owns thanks in part to a previous decision by McCormick. The judge oversaw Twitter\u2019s suit against Musk that ended in him agreeing to close his $44 billion deal. Musk largely financed the Twitter acquisition by selling his Tesla stock.\n\u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\u201d Musk posted on X. Musk later posted a poll asking whether Tesla should change its state of incorporation to Texas.\nThis question of \u201cfairness\u201d was central to the case, which kicked off in 2019 when Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta filed a suit to rescind Musk\u2019s 2018 pay deal, claiming at the time that the package was unjustly paid to Musk without demanding he focus entirely on the carmaker.\nThe compensation plan approved by shareholders in 2018 consisted of 20.3 million stock option awards broken up into 12 tranches of 1.69 million shares. Under the agreement, the options vested in 12 increments if Tesla hit specific milestones on market cap, revenue and adjusted earnings (excluding certain one-time charges such as stock compensation).\nWhile many may argue that it was fair because the vast majority of shareholders approved it, McCormick was unmoved. She wrote because the \u201cdefendants were unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process.\u201d\nMcCormick described the process leading to the approval of Musk\u2019s compensation plan as \u201cdeeply flawed,\u201d largely because of his deep ties to the people, including board members, who were supposed to be negotiating on Tesla\u2019s behalf. She also noted that testimony illustrated that this was less a negotiation and more a cooperative venture.\nMcCormick also weighed in the fairness of the \u201cprice.\u201d Defendants urged the court to compare what Tesla \u201cgave\u201d against what Tesla \u201cgot.\u201d Her assessment was not enough. She writes:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe compensation plan was not conditioned on Musk devoting any set amount of time to Tesla because the board never proposed such a term. Swept up by the rhetoric of \u201call upside,\u201d or perhaps starry eyed by Musk\u2019s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?\u201d\nShe did agree that the defendants (Tesla) proved Musk was \u201cuniquely motivated by ambitious goals and that Tesla desperately needed Musk to succeed in its next stage of development.\u201d But, she added, \u201cthese facts do not justify the largest compensation plan in the history of public markets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",

Its previous fund totaled $100 million.\nThe firm invests across climate, health and what it calls \u201cpurpose-driven\u201d startups and some used to call \u201cimpact\u201d or \u201cmission-driven.\u201d\nWhatever the case, the raise consists of a new $100 million seed fund which will aim to back around 25 early-stage companies, while a $150 million climate-focused growth fund will aim at Series B companies. The firm says it\u2019s made 10 investments so far from the two funds.\nPrior to this, Giant had invested in mental health app Calm,\u00a0carbon removal platform Agreena, British energy storage startup Field (which has raised $300 million) and health industry startup Doccla.\nPart of Giant\u2019s main \u201cpitch\u201d to startups, if you will, is that it is led by former founders and operators in a European ecosystem where 92% of European venture capitalists have never worked at a startup. The firm is led by Cameron McLain, an exited founder, and Tommy Stadlen, co-founder of Swing Technologies (acquired by Microsoft).\nAdmittedly that has begun to change in recent years with the appearance of new funds such as Plural, which is helmed by exited founders from Wise, Songkick and others. Plural recently raised a fresh \u20ac400 million fund.\nOver a call, Stadlen told me: \u201cHalf of this capital is going into European companies, including the U.K., and then half of it is going into the U.S. companies. So we\u2019re fully transatlantic. We\u2019ve got people in London, where the headquarters is, but also we have folks in Copenhagen, Stockholm, New York and California.\u201d\nAdvisory board members include former BP CEO Lord Browne, former British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and 23andme founder Linda Avey.\nGiant\u2019s LPs include BMW, Henkel, RIT Capital Partners, clients of Cambridge Associates, Stepstone, Denmark\u2019s sovereign investment fund, The Nature Conservancy (U.S.) and Sir Richard Branson.\nThe news is not unwelcome in an environment where Britain has consistently ranked near the bottom of the G7 in recent years for all sources of private investment in the economy.\nAlthough several U.K. VC\u2019s signed up to a scheme to boost investment in startups last year, this will undoubtedly take a while to filter through the ecosystem.\nVC in Europe has been hit by a weak economy, and has been mostly flat over the last two years. Startup investment slumped in 2023 to $45 billion.\nMeanwhile, North American investors are retrenching, with Omers and Coatue downgrading their activity.\n",

      "content": "\nIn 2007 I was running late for my speech at the Polish Stock Exchange, but the cool reception I received there suggested I should perhaps not have bothered. Speaking about the new wave of tech startups emerging from Silicon Valley and how Europe was next, I was met with a lot of puzzled blinking. That audience clearly wasn\u2019t the right one, or in the right place. But in the high schools and universities, Poland\u2019s youth was busy hoovering up engineering and business courses to get their ecosystem underway.\nFast-forward to 2024 and Poland\u2019s startup (and exit) ecosystem bears little resemblance to 2007. Some highly successful tech companies have emerged from the country, including Brainly, Booksy, Docplanner, Ramp and many others. Not to mention the on-fire games sector. \u201cThe Witcher\u201d games were published in Poland by CD Projekt and worldwide by Atari, for instance.\nPoland\u2019s hot ecosystem even reached the point where there was so much to write about I had to split my 2020 survey of Poland\u2019s VC scene into two parts.\nFurther evidence that the scene is still on a roll emerges today in the news that Poland\u2019s SMOK Ventures has closed its second fund at the $25 million mark.\nNow, before you scoff at that figure, remember the geography it\u2019s deploying in. Backing early-stage software tools, SaaS, AI and gaming startups in Central and Eastern Europe, SMOK has been part of a new wave of VCs in the region.\nAnd as you can see from the 2020 survey, we counted at least 20 VCs operating in Poland (mostly out of Warsaw).\nPoland is also poised to feel the economic benefits of ridding itself of a socially conservative government, which has acted as a drag on society, in the wake of the victory by former EU chief Donald Tusk.\nBorys Musielak, SMOK\u2019s general partner (who sold Filmaster to Samba TV) and whose co-founder is Diana Koziarska (former CEO at ReaktorX), told me over a call: \u201cMost of our investments are in software development tools and game development. Those are the two biggest sectors in Poland\u2026 It\u2019s the engineers understanding engineering tools and they build engineering tools for other engineers\u2026 Those are really Poland\u2019s strengths.\u201d\nHe said fundraising had been tough because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its fallout amongst LPs nervous about the region. Although Poland has absorbed 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees relatively easily, much of the tech talent has stayed in Ukraine where it has pivoted to defense, for obvious reasons.\nThat said, Musielak told me Ukrainian startups continue to appear and make investable prospects. Finmap is a Ukrainian-origin startup backed by SMOK, for instance. The cash flow management tool for small business owners has raised around $2 million so far.\nSMOK\u2019s first fund from 2019 was $10 million and was deployed in 24 startups and went into startups including SunRoof, Vue Storefront and inStreamly.\nThe majority of that first fund came from Poland\u2019s government-tied PFR Ventures, but this second fund is backed by PFR\u2019s separate investment pocket which does not contain EU funding. The new fund includes 60+ private LPs, with, says the firm, most of the LPs being entrepreneurs coming from CEE. OnDean Forward, with Andrew Sieja (founder of Relativity, a Polish/Chicago unicorn) and Marcin Wojtczak (former executive at Relativity and Bain) are among the new major LPs, for instance.\nSMOK will use the new fund to invest in pre-seed and seed startups (investing around $100,000-$1 million) both from CEE, but also has the freedom to deploy anywhere in the world, now that it has less EU institutional funds as LPs.\nThe fund writes cheques of $100,000 to $1 million and, to date, it has invested in 12 startups, spread across countries such as Poland, Ukraine, Croatia, Bulgaria and others. Investments include Gotiva, 57hours and Ukraine\u2019s Finmap.\nSMOK also has a useful card up its sleeve when it wants to network its portfolio in the U.S. or internationally. It is part of a network of funds managed by the prolific \u2014 and somewhat idiosyncratic (he\u2019s a U.S.-citizen who once competed in the Olympics for Columbia) \u2014 U.S. investor Paul Bragiel. His investment network focuses on emerging markets and includes Golden Gate Ventures (Southeast Asia), Niu Ventures (South America), Bragiel Brothers (North America), Savannah (Africa) and Sisu Game Ventures (gamedev focus).\nAlthough a formal GP in SMOK, Bragiel is not operational day-to-day, but because he was an early investor in Uber, this no doubt comes in handy when SMOK needs to network its portfolio in the U.S.\nThis latest news makes it clear that Poland\u2019s tech ecosystem is continuing to punch above its weight both regionally and internationally.\n",
